    Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection is an effective technology for the inactivation of pathogens in
    water and is of growing interest for industrial application. A new UV source — ultraviolet light-
    emitting diode (UV-LED) — has emerged in the past decade with a number of advantages
    compared to traditional UV mercury lamps. This promising alternative raises great interest in the
    research on application of UV-LEDs for water treatment. Studies on UV-LED water disinfection
    have increased during the past few years. This article presents a comprehensive review of recent
    studies on UV-LEDs with various wavelengths for the inactivation of different microorganisms.
    Many inconsistent and incomparable data were found from published studies, which underscores
    the importance of establishing a standard protocol for studying UV-LED inactivation of
    microorganisms. Different UV sensitivities to UV-LEDs and traditional UV lamps were
    observed in the literature for some microorganisms, which requires further investigation for a
    better understanding of microorganism response to UV-LEDs. The unique aspects of UV-LEDs
    improve inactivation effectiveness by applying LED special features, such as multiple
    wavelengths and pulsed illumination; however, more studies are needed to investigate the
    influencing factors and mechanisms. The special features of UV-LEDs offer the flexibility of
    novel reactor designs for a broad application of UV-LED reactors.

    Drinking water safety is an important issue worldwide, especially in most developing
    countries and rural areas. Millions of people around the world lack access to a safe drinking
    water source and are threatened by waterborne diseases annually (Hatami, 2013; WHO, 2014).
    The development of efficient water treatment technologies, especially inactivation of pathogenic
    microorganisms in water, is of great significance for human health and well-being.
    Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can effectively inactivate various microorganisms in water
    (Hijnen et al., 2006) and has been increasingly used for water disinfection. UV radiation has
    numerous advantages over conventional chemical disinfection (e.g., chlorination or ozonation),
    such as no chemical addition, no harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation, and no
    introduction of disinfectant-resistance to bacteria (Mori et al., 2007). UV disinfection has been
    recommended as a substitute for chemical additives for surface water treatment (USEPA, 2006).
    Currently, there are more than 7,000 municipal UV disinfection installations in the world (Muller,
    2011), and small household UV disinfection systems are also available (Brownell et al., 2008). It
    is estimated that the global market for UV disinfection equipment has a potential to reach $2.8
    billion by 2020 (Allied Analytics LLP, 2014). The main UV sources for current UV disinfection
    systems are low- or medium-pressure mercury lamps (Chevremont et al., 2013a). Although these
    lamps are widely used in water treatment systems, there are still many issues with them. The
    major concern is that the UV lamps are fragile and contain toxic mercury, which is hazardous to
    the environment and requires proper disposal (Chevremont et al., 2013b; Close et al., 2006).
    Moreover, these lamps require significant amounts of energy to operate due to a low wall plug
    efficiency of around 15–35% and have a relatively short lifetime of about 10,000 hours (Autin et
    al., 2013; Chatterley and Linden, 2010).
    In the past few years, with the rapid development and improvement of the semiconductor
    industry, UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new source for UV radiation
    generation. An LED is a semiconductor device that utilizes semiconducting materials to create a
    p-n junction (hole and electron). The electrons and holes recombine at the junction to emit
    radiation, and the wavelength of the radiation depends on the semiconducting materials.
    Commercial visible LEDs have been available for nearly 50 years and have diverse applications,
    especially in the lighting industry, due to the increasingly higher efficiency and lower cost
    (Ibrahim et al., 2014). Recently, the newly emerging UV-LEDs have followed a similar track and
    are expected to be economically viable in the coming years (Harris et al., 2013).
    UV-LEDs at various wavelengths can be manufactured using different semiconducting
    materials. The most frequently used materials are III-nitride, including gallium nitride (GaN),
    aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN), and aluminum nitride (AlN) (Khan et al., 2005). The
    wavelength of GaN-based UV-LEDs can be as short as 365 nm, which is in the near UV region
    (Taniyasu et al., 2006b). However, the AIN UV-LEDs are reported to emit UV radiation at 210
    nm (deep UV), which is the shortest wavelength among semiconductors (Taniyasu et al., 2006a).
    A wavelength from 210 to 365 nm (covering from deep UV to near UV regions) is available
    from the emission of AlGaN, which consists of AIN and GaN in appropriate proportions
    (Taniyasu and Kasu, 2010). Because the wavelength is found to be an essential factor for water
    disinfection efficiency (Vilhunen et al., 2009), the ability of UV-LEDs to offer a variety of
    wavelengths is well aligned with the needs of efficient disinfection, making it a potential option.
    In addition to diversity in wavelengths, UV-LEDs possess several unique advantages such
    as environmental friendliness (no mercury), compactness and robustness (more durable), faster
    start-up time (no warm-up time), potentially less energy consumption, longer lifetime, and the
    ability to turn on and off with high frequency (Wurtele et al., 2011). It is predicted that by 2020,
    UV-LEDs will operate at 75% wall plug efficiency with a lifetime longer than 100,000 hours,
    comparable to the operating parameters of current visible LEDs (Autin et al., 2013; Ibrahim et al.,
    2014). All these factors make UV-LEDs a promising alternative to conventional UV mercury
    lamps for water disinfection. However, due to the substantial differences between the traditional
    mercury lamps and newly emerging UV-LEDs, the numerous research results and established
    methodologies on water disinfection by mercury lamps, such as experimental protocols, reactor
    designs, and inactivation kinetics, may not apply directly to UV-LEDs. Moreover, few studies
    currently exist that investigate the application of UV-LEDs to water disinfection. Therefore, a
    comprehensive research on UV-LEDs for water disinfection is essential to better understand the
    feasibility and future applications of this technology.
    This review presents and discusses published data from the literature, aiming to give an
    overall understanding of UV-LED water disinfection. Using the results of this review, some of
    the main future research directions are identified. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is
    the first review paper on the application of newly emerging UV-LEDs for water disinfection."""},

    There has been a lack of uniformity in research materials and methods reported for UV-
LED disinfection studies over the last decade, making comparisons difficult. Table 1 summarizes
the main results from the published work on UV-LED water disinfection. The data on UV dose
and log inactivation were obtained from each study, and the UV dose response, as the value of
(unit: mJ/cm2 per log inactivation), was calculated to evaluate and compare the
effectiveness of disinfection among different studies.
The germicidal efficiency of UV radiation was reported to be highly dependent on the
wavelength, and the spectral sensitivity of microorganisms was found to not necessarily follow
the DNA absorbance spectrum (Chen et al., 2009, Mamane-Gravetz et al., 2005). Therefore, UV
wavelength is an essential factor for microorganism inactivation, and the effectiveness may vary
from microorganism to microorganism (Linden et al., 2001, Vilhunen et al., 2009). Different UV
wavelengths in the range of 315–400 nm (UVA), 280–315 nm (UVB), and <280 nm (UVC) have
been applied for microorganism inactivation by UV-LEDs. From the published data, sorted by
wavelength (Table 1), the influence of UV-LED wavelengths on inactivation effectiveness can
be evaluated.
Hamamoto et al. (2007) and Mori et al. (2007) applied UVA radiation with 365-nm UVA-
LEDs on E. coli and obtained UV dose responses of 55,263 and 13,846 mJ/cm2 per log
inactivation, respectively (Table 1). These values are high considering that typically the UV dose
required by 254-nm mercury lamps for 4 log E. coli inactivation is about 8 mJ/cm2, which makes
the UV dose response only 2 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation (Bolton and Cotton, 2008). With the
help of titanium dioxide (TiO2), Xiong and Hu (2013) established a photocatalytic disinfection
system using 365-nm UV-LEDs, and the results still showed a high UV dose response of 229
mJ/cm2 per log inactivation for E. coli inactivation. These results demonstrated that 365-nm
UVA-LEDs alone are not effective for microorganism inactivation.
Oguma et al. (2013) used 310-nm UVB-LEDs for E. coli inactivation and reported a UV
dose response of 94.8 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation, which is much lower than that required for
365-nm UVA-LEDs. Nonetheless, this result was far greater than the values reported for UVC-
LEDs for various microorganisms, which ranged from 1.0 to 30.5 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation
(Table 1). Therefore, UVB-LEDs alone are also not highly effective for microorganism
inactivation.
Aoyagi et al. (2011) selected 255-nm and 280-nm UVC-LEDs to study the inactivation
effects on bacteriophages φX174, Qβ, and MS2. The results showed that the UV dose responses
at 280 nm for these three microorganisms were 2.8, 28.7, and 30.5 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation,
respectively (Table 1), which were all higher than those at 255 nm (1.7, 12.5, and 12.8 mJ/cm2
per log inactivation, respectively). The results indicated that UVC-LEDs at 255 nm could be
more effective than at 280 nm for the inactivation of bacteriophages φX174, Qβ, and MS2.
Another study on UVC-LEDs at 255 nm and 275 nm was reported by Bowker et al. (2011)
for the inactivation of three microorganisms: MS2, T7, and E. coli. Similar UV dose responses
were obtained from this study for the 255-nm and 275-nm wavelengths (26.1, 5.1, and 3.3
mJ/cm2 per log inactivation versus 28.6, 4.3, and 2.4 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation for MS2, T7,
and E. coli, respectively; Table 1). For MS2, the UV dose response at 255 nm was slightly lower
than that at 275 nm, indicating that UVC-LED at 255 nm was more effective than at 275 nm.
However, for T7 and E. coli, 255 nm resulted in slightly higher UV dose responses than at 275
nm, suggesting that 275 nm was more effective. The results for MS2 and T7 were consistent with
their action spectra, considering that the action spectrum of MS2 has a peak around 260 nm and
the peak for T7 is around 270 nm (Mamane-Gravetz et al., 2005, Ronto et al., 1992, Beck et al.,
2015). The results did not agree with the E. coli action spectrum given that 255 nm is closer to
the peak around 260–265 nm and therefore 255 nm is expected to be more effective than 275 nm
(Bolton and Cotton, 2008). The higher effectiveness of 275 nm may be attributed to the higher
output power of the 275-nm UV-LEDs, resulting in a higher fluence rate and shorter exposure
time to reach the same UV dose, which is proposed to be more effective for E. coli inactivation
than the combination of a lower fluence rate and longer exposure time (Bowker et al., 2011,
Harm, 1980, Sommer et al., 1998). Basically, UV inactivation of microorganisms is believed to
follow the Bunsen–Roscoe reciprocity law, which states that the photochemical effect depends
only on the total energy dose, i.e., the product of fluence rate and exposure time (Murata and
Osakabe, 2013). This was verified by Sommer et al. (1998) who reported that for inactivation of
bacteriophages MS2, φX174, and B40-8 by mercury UV lamps, log inactivation is the same as
long as the product of fluence rate and exposure time is the same. At the same time, these authors
found a deviation from the reciprocity law for E. coli inactivation that showed a higher fluence
rate and shorter exposure time resulted in a higher log inactivation than a lower fluence rate and
a longer exposure time despite the total UV fluence (UV dose) being the same. This phenomenon
could be attributed to UV disinfection depending not only on photochemical reactions but also
on biological processes (Harm, 1980). Therefore, the deviation from the reciprocity law may
occur on certain microorganisms, like E. coli, because the biological processes induced by UV
radiation may vary with different microorganisms, and some of the organisms may be more
sensitive to the fluence rate.
Although some of the UV-LED dose responses reported from different studies are in
agreement, there are many cases where the results are inconsistent. One such example is the
inconsistency in results between studies by Aoyagi et al. (2011) and Bowker et al. (2011). Both
studies used 255-nm UVC-LEDs for MS2 inactivation. However, in the former case, a 41-
mJ/cm2 UV dose provided a 3.2 log inactivation, whereas in the latter, a 60-mJ/cm2 UV dose
achieved only 2.3 log inactivation. Similar inconsistent results were also observed between the
studies by Chatterley and Linden (2010) and Oguma et al. (2013), where both applied 265 nm to
E. coli and reported UV dose responses of 5.9 and 2.7 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation, respectively.
These disagreements might result from the differences among materials and experimental
conditions in the different studies. Different UV-LEDs in these studies have various radiation
patterns, such as emission spectra, viewing angle, and radiation distribution. Various apparatuses
were applied for UV-LED water disinfection, and different methods were used to determine the
UV dose from the UV-LEDs. Currently, there is no consistent methodology for obtaining the
UV-LED dose response of microorganisms, and there is no standard protocol for determining the
UV dose delivered by UV-LEDs to a sample solution. Therefore, the discrepancy among
different studies is inevitable.
The standardized protocol for microorganism inactivation by conventional UV mercury
lamps has been well established, and the results under the standardized procedure are comparable
(Bolton and Linden, 2003, Kuo et al., 2003). However, the UV lamp protocol is not expected to
be directly applicable to UV-LEDs because of the substantial differences between mercury lamps
and UV-LEDs. The bench-scale UV disinfection experiments for mercury lamps usually utilize a
collimated beam apparatus (Fig.1A). The key part of this apparatus—a collimated beam—is used
to provide a uniform irradiation field on a surface area by collimating a parallel beam to
vertically project on the water surface, so that the irradiance on the surface of the sample can be
accurately measured by a radiometer, enabling the UV dose to be determined with necessary
corrections (Bolton and Linden, 2003). To ensure the uniformity of the beam and accuracy of the
measurement, the length of the collimated beam has to be at least 20 cm (Blatchley, 1997). Such
a long collimated beam is not practical for UV-LEDs due to their low radiant power. Currently,
the output power of a UVC-LED is only several milliwatts, which is much lower than that of
low-pressure mercury UV lamps (typically 40 W) or high-output medium-pressure mercury
lamps (up to 30 kW). As a result, the UV-LEDs have to be close to a water sample in which
inactivation is performed for deliverable UV energy. Various apparatus can be applied for UV-
LED inactivation of microorganisms. Typically, the UV-LEDs are located directly above the
water sample (Fig.1B), and the distance between UV-LEDs and the water sample is usually no
more than 2 cm (Chevremont et al., 2012a, Chevremont et al., 2012b, Hamamoto et al., 2007,
Hwang et al., 2013, Li et al., 2010, Mori et al., 2007, Oguma et al., 2013, Vilhunen et al., 2009).
Considering that a UV-LED is a point source and emits hemispheric radiation, the UV emission
from a UV-LED is neither parallel nor vertical to the water surface within such a short distance
between the UV-LED and the water sample (Fig.1B). As a result, uniform irradiance is not
expected on the water sample surface, which leads to difficulties for the accurate determination
of UV dose. Further, the radiant power of UV-LEDs can be significantly affected by operating
parameters, such as the applied current and voltage, and by thermal management during the
operation. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a standardized protocol for a UV-
LED-based inactivation study of microorganisms, especially for the accurate determination of
UV dose and the proper operation of the system. This necessity has been recognized by
researchers and industry leaders in the field of UV-LEDs. Recently, an International Ultraviolet
Association (IUVA) initiative has been announced, undertaken by a working group of the IUVA
Manufacturers Council, to present a consistent methodology for the determination and
benchmarking of UVC output from LEDs (IUVA, 2015).
Chevremont et al. (2012a) studied the inactivation effect of coupled UVA- and UVC-LEDs
on mesophilic bacteria. The UV dose responses for UVA alone at 365 nm and 405 nm were 12.5
and 88 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation, which are much higher than those for the UVC alone at 254
nm and 280 nm (both 1.0 mJ/cm2 per log inactivation). However, when combining UVA- and
UVC-LEDs, the UV dose responses at 254/365 nm, 280/365 nm, 254/405 nm, and 280/405 nm
all sharply decreased (2.1, 1.6, 11.9, and 7.7 mJ/cm
2 per log inactivation, respectively),
indicating that the combination of UVA- and UVC-LEDs is more efficient than UVA-LEDs
alone. Moreover, in terms of log inactivation, it was found that the combination of 280 nm and
365 nm provided higher log inactivation than the sum of each alone (3.5 > 1.4 + 0.3 = 1.7). The
other three combinations showed similar phenomena: 254/365 nm (2.4 > 0.8 + 0.3 = 1.1),
254/405 nm (2.2 > 0.8 + 0.3 = 1.1), and 280/365 nm (3.5 > 1.4 + 0.3 = 1.7). This synergistic
effect from the wavelength combinations was also reported by Nakahashi et al. (2014), who
combined 254 nm with 365 nm for Vibrio parahaemolyticus inactivation. However, Oguma et al.
(2013) combined 265-nm, 280-nm, and 310-nm UV-LEDs for E. coli inactivation and did not
observe a synergistic effect. On the contrary, these researchers found that combined wavelengths
were less efficient than each wavelength applied separately, which could have resulted from
different indicator microorganisms and wavelength combinations, as well as an inefficient
thermal management of the experimental setup (Oguma et al., 2013). These studies suggest that
combination of selected wavelengths might be a promising way to improve the disinfection
efficiency of UV-LEDs, but more studies are needed because the experimental setup and
conditions may be influential.
Although a medium-pressure mercury lamp can provide polychromatic radiation, its
spectrum, which includes UVA, UVB, UVC, and visible light, is fixed and cannot be adjusted.
Different effects and mechanisms for medium-pressure mercury lamp inactivation of
microorganisms have been attributed to its polychromatic radiation. However, within the very
broad range of wavelengths in its spectrum, it is difficult to identify and distinguish which
wavelength or which combination of specific wavelengths the additional effects and mechanisms
result from. UV-LEDs provide great flexibility for wavelength combinations and fluence rate
due to their unique feature of wavelength diversity. This flexibility offers a new approach to
tailor wavelength combinations and the radiant power of each peak wavelength for optimal
inactivation and to identify the additional mechanism of a particular combination and fluence
rate.
The ability to turn on and off with a high frequency is another unique feature of UV-LEDs,
enabling adjustable UV pulsed illumination. Such a feature makes UV-LEDs desirable for
potentially enhancing the inactivation effectiveness by pulsed irradiation. Li et al. (2010)
reported enhanced germicidal effects of pulsed UV-LED irradiation by applying UVA-LED at
365 nm for inactivation of Candida albicans and E. coli biofilms. They found that pulsed
irradiation had significantly greater germicidal ability than continuous irradiation with a
maximum at 100 Hz and 75% duty rate (the percentage of the exposure time in total operating
time) under the same UV dose. Wengraitis et al. (2013) applied pulsed UVC radiation by UV-
LEDs at 272 nm for E. coli disinfection on agar plates and found it to be more effective than
continuous illumination; the log inactivation for pulsed UVC radiation at 272 nm with 1 Hz and
10% duty rate was 3.8 times higher than that of continuous illumination based on the same UV
dose, indicating the high efficiency of pulsed UV radiation.
The conventional UV source for generating pulsed UV is a xenon lamp. The enhanced
germicidal effect of xenon lamp-pulsed UV has been demonstrated by studies for food
decontamination and water disinfection (Bohrerova et al., 2008, Elmnasser et al., 2007, Gomez-
Lopez et al., 2007, Oms-Oliu et al., 2010). However, the pulses generated by a xenon lamp are
different from those of UV-LEDs in terms of spectrum, intensity, frequency, and duty rate. The
wavelength distribution of xenon lamp pulses ranges from 100 nm to 1000 nm, including UV,
visible light, and infrared with a peak power up to 35 MW. Usually the duration of each pulse is
from nanoseconds to milliseconds, and typically 1 to 20 pulses are emitted per second (Oms-Oliu
et al., 2010). As discussed previously, UV-LEDs have selectable wavelengths with relatively low
radiant power and are capable of highly adjustable pulsed illumination with broad ranges for
frequency and duty rate. The numerous studies on xenon lamp-pulsed UV reveal that these pulse
patterns play important roles for enhanced germicidal effect (Elmnasser et al., 2007). Therefore,
due to the differences in pulse patterns, the direct applicability of the findings on xenon lamp-
pulsed UV to UV-LED pulsed illumination is not expected, and more studies on UV-LED pulsed
illumination are needed to confirm the enhanced germicidal effect.

    Although UV radiation is effective against most pathogenic microorganisms in water,
different microorganisms have different responses to UV radiation due to various UV resistances
and process conditions. The sensitivity of microorganisms to UV radiation can be evaluated by
the inactivation rate constant k (cm2/mJ) from the linear portion of the relationship between log
inactivation and the applied UV dose (Hijnen et al., 2006):
Log inactivation = k * UV dose
The k values for various microorganisms were calculated based on the data from each study
(summarized in Table 1), and are listed in Table 2. The data from conventional UV mercury
lamps at 254 nm are also shown in Table 2 for comparison. A high k value means the
microorganism is UV sensitive and requires a low UV dose for inactivation.
The k values for bacteriophage φX174 by 255-nm and 280-nm UV-LEDs were reported as
0.578 and 0.360 cm2/mJ, respectively (Aoyagi et al., 2011), which were higher than all other
microorganisms in Table 2, suggesting that φX174 is very vulnerable to UVC radiation. The k
value for φX174 by 254 nm was also much higher than that for most of the other microorganisms
in the studies concerning UV lamps. However, the k value of UV lamps at 254 nm was closer to
that of UV-LEDs at 280 nm instead of 255 nm. This disagreement may result from the
differences between these two UV sources, including the fact that the UV fluence rate of
conventional UV lamps is much higher than that for UV-LEDs, which may affect the
microorganism responses (Harm, 1980). On the other hand, φX174 inactivation by UV lamps
showed no sensitivity to different fluence rates based on the study by Sommer et al. (1998).
Nonetheless, further research is needed to investigate the UV-LED wavelength effect given the
dearth of literature on this aspect.
E. coli inactivation was investigated with UVC-LEDs at different wavelengths (255, 265,
272, 275, and 280 nm) in several studies (Bowker et al., 2011, Chatterley and Linden, 2010,
Oguma et al., 2013, Wengraitis et al., 2013). The k values ranged from 0.170 to 0.422 cm2/mJ,
which were slightly lower than the values for φX174, indicating that E. coli is quite sensitive to
UVC radiation. The wide range of k values suggests that UV sensitivity of E. coli largely
depends on the wavelength. Moreover, although these studies used E. coli as the indicator
microorganism, the strains of E. coli were different, which could be a factor that results in the
different inactivation rate constants because UV sensitivity may vary with different strains of a
species, especially for E. coli (Malley, 2004, Sommer et al., 1998, Sommer et al., 2000). The
average k value from UV lamp studies for E. coli inactivation was 0.506 cm2/mJ, which was
higher than the values found using UV-LEDs, with 275 nm resulting in the closest value, rather
than the 255-nm UV-LED. A possible explanation may be the difference of fluence rate from
UV lamps and UV-LEDs since a few studies have found that the fluence rate can affect E. coli
inactivation (Bowker et al., 2011, Harm, 1980, Sommer et al., 1998). As previously discussed,
although UV-LEDs are usually placed very close to the water sample for UV exposure (Fig. 1),
the fluence rate is still much lower than that of UV lamps due to the low output power of current
UV-LEDs, which could be an influencing factor. Bowker et al. (2011) compared a 254-nm UV
lamp with 275-nm and 255-nm UV-LEDs for E. coli inactivation. The fluence rates were 0.34,
0.094–0.11, and 0.049–0.060 mW/cm2, respectively. The results showed that log inactivation for
the same UV dose increased concurrently with the increase in fluence rate: from the 255-nm UV-
LED to the 275-nm UV-LED to the 254-nm UV lamp. These results support the hypothesis that
the combination of a higher fluence rate and shorter exposure time may result in higher E. coli
inactivation as previously discussed, which could explain the influence of different UV sources.
Bacteriophage T7 was found to have k values of 0.195 and 0.235 cm2/mJ by 255-nm and
275-nm UV-LEDs, respectively (Bowker et al., 2011), which were slightly lower than those of E.
coli, indicating that T7 was also sensitive to UVC radiation. The k value for 275 nm was slightly
higher than that of 255 nm, suggesting that T7 was more sensitive to 275 nm than to 255 nm, in
agreement with the action spectrum of T7 bacteriophage with a peak around 270 nm (Ronto et al.,
1992, Beck et al., 2015). The k value of a UV lamp for T7 was 0.232 cm2/mJ, which was close to
that found with the 275-nm UV-LED but far from the 255-nm UV-LED, implying that T7 may
also be sensitive to fluence rate, as previously discussed.
Bacillus subtilis spores were inactivated in two studies (Morris, 2012, Wurtele et al., 2011)
by UV-LEDs with three different wavelengths (250, 269, and 282 nm). The k values for 269 nm
and 282 nm were 0.148 and 0.120 cm2/mJ, respectively, but the k value decreased dramatically
to 0.051 cm2/mJ for 250 nm. These results seemed to be related to the action spectrum of
Bacillus subtilis spores, which have a peak around 265 nm and a trough around 240 nm
(Mamane-Gravetz et al., 2005). The k value for Bacillus subtilis spores by a UV lamp was 0.059 
cm 2/mJ, which was similar to that of a 250-nm UV-LED, showing a consistency in the UV
sensitivity of Bacillus subtilis spores between the two different UV sources.
Bacteriophage Qβ inactivation by 255-nm and 288-nm UV-LEDs resulted in k values of
0.080 and 0.035 cm2/mJ, respectively (Aoyagi et al., 2011), which were lower than most of the
microorganisms listed in Table 2, indicating that bacteriophage Qβ was highly resistant to UVC
radiation. The k value at 255 nm was significantly higher than that at 280 nm, which agreed well
with the action spectrum of Qβ having a peak between 260 and 265 nm (Beck et al., 2015). The k
value for the 255-nm UV-LED agreed well with the values from low-pressure UV lamp
inactivation studies for Qβ (0.084 cm2/mJ), implying that Qβ had the same UV sensitivity at
different UV sources.
Bacteriophage MS2 inactivation was reported in two studies (Aoyagi et al., 2011, Bowker et
al., 2011) using UV-LEDs at three different wavelengths (255, 275, and 280 nm). The k values
for 280 nm from the former study and 255, 275 nm from the latter study were close (0.033, 0.038,
and 0.035 cm2/mJ, respectively) and among the lowest of all the microorganisms inactivated by
UVC radiation, indicating that MS2 was highly resistant to UVC radiation. The k value for 255
nm from the former study was 0.078 cm2/mJ, which was higher than the other values. This result
matched the action spectrum of MS2, which has a peak around 260 nm (Mamane-Gravetz et al.,
2005, Beck et al., 2015). Although these two studies showed different k values for the 255-nm
UV-LED on MS2 inactivation, the average was 0.058 cm
inactivation by conventional UV lamps (0.055 cm2/mJ). This finding suggested that MS2 might
2/mJ, which was close to that for MS2
also be insensitive to different fluence rates from UV-LEDs and conventional UV lamps.
These studies have demonstrated the diversity of UV responses for different
microorganisms to various wavelengths. Because UV response largely depends on the indicator
microorganisms and applied wavelength by UV-LEDs, a particular wavelength could be much
more effective for a specific microorganism. Unlike UV lamps, UV-LEDs can be designed to
emit a particular wavelength that targets a specific pathogen of concern. In addition, the selected
wavelengths could be combined by applying various UV-LEDs to produce a synergistic effect
(Taghipour, 2013). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of microorganism responses to
UV-LEDs with different wavelengths and wavelength combinations is essential to take full
advantage of UV-LEDs for water disinfection.
Additionally, from the comparison with conventional UV mercury lamps at 254 nm, some
microorganisms showed different UV sensitivities to different UV sources at the same
wavelength, indicating that the characteristics and performance of UV sources, such as the
fluence rate, may play important roles in microorganism inactivation. Microorganisms were
previously shown to exhibit higher UV sensitivities to medium-pressure mercury lamps than to
low-pressure mercury lamps (Hijnen et al., 2006). However, few studies compare UV-LEDs and
UV lamps. Thus, more studies are required to better understand how different UV sources affect
microorganism inactivation using UV-LEDs compared with UV lamps."""},

Some studies reported time-response data for microorganism inactivation by UV-LEDs
instead of dose-response data (Table 3). The UV exposure times ranged from 30 seconds to 2
hours, and log inactivation ranged from 2 to 7; both results showed a wide range and seemed
incomparable. Because no quantitative data on UV dose were provided in these studies, it was
difficult to analyze and compare the effectiveness of UV-LED inactivation. The difficulty was
most likely caused by the lack of an established standard method for the measurement of UV
dose associated with the newly emerging UV-LEDs, which are substantially different from UV
mercury lamps as discussed previously. This issue demonstrates the significance of UV-LED
characterization and the need for standard protocols for UV-LED microorganism inactivation
and water disinfection.

Many studies have discussed the mechanism of microorganism inactivation by UV-LEDs,
and various mechanisms have been proposed. Much like the conventional mercury-based UV
lamps, UVC radiation has proven to be efficient for microorganism inactivation, and most
studies on UV-LED disinfection used UVC-LEDs. UVC radiation is believed to have direct
germicidal effects by acting directly on the DNA of microorganisms, leading to the formation of
pyrimidine dimers and preventing them from reproducing without intermediate steps (Chatterley
and Linden, 2010, Chevremont et al., 2012a, Chevremont et al., 2012b, Hamamoto et al., 2007).
Because DNA mainly absorbs UV radiation from 200 to 300 nm with an absorbance peak around
260 nm (Wurtele et al., 2011), UVC-LEDs, especially those with the wavelengths around 260
nm, are the most efficient for microorganism inactivation (Table 1). However, direct damage to
DNA might be reparable by DNA-repair mechanisms, such as photo-reactivation and dark repair
(Oguma et al., 2001, Oguma et al., 2013, Sanz et al., 2007). Since DNA repair is undesirable for
microorganism inactivation, it is necessary to weaken or prevent the repair. DNA repair might be
prevented by damaging the repair enzymes, which are proposed to be more vulnerable to high
UV intensities (Sommer et al., 1998). Moreover, the absorption spectrum of protein has a peak
around 280 nm, which might help damage repair enzymes and prevent DNA repair (Kalisvaart, 2004).
Although UVA radiation is poorly absorbed by DNA and is less efficient in inducing
damage on DNA (Sinha and Hader, 2002), it still has the ability to inactivate microorganisms
(Kalisvaart, 2004). The current commercially available UVA-LEDs have much higher output
power and energy efficiency than UVC-LEDs (Aoyagi et al., 2011, Harris et al., 2013,
Muramoto et al., 2014), resulting in many studies on the application of UVA-LEDs for
microorganism inactivation. The inactivation mechanism of UVA radiation has not been studied
as widely as UVC radiation because the frequently used UV mercury lamps can only emit UVC
radiation at 254 nm. The main mechanism of UVA inactivation involves an indirect effect by
reactive intermediates and oxidative damage to DNA and other cellular components (Chatterley
and Linden, 2010, Chevremont et al., 2012a, Chevremont et al., 2012b, Hamamoto et al., 2007,
Hwang et al., 2013). The reactive intermediates are proposed to be reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which are created by UVA radiation via photooxidation of oxygen. Studies showed that
addition of mannitol and catalase significantly protected microorganisms from 365-nm UVA-
LEDs radiation by scavenging hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
respectively. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide are believed to be the major
reactive oxygen species involved in UVA disinfection (Hamamoto et al., 2007, Li et al., 2010).
These reactive intermediates induce oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and cell membranes
and cause growth delay (Eisenstark, 1987, Oppezzo and Pizarro, 2001, Pizarro, 1995, Pizarro
and Orce, 1988, Ramabhadran and Jagger, 1976, Sinha and Hader, 2002). This process takes
more time than the direct damage produced by UVC radiation (Chatterley and Linden, 2010).
Although the indirect damage by UVA radiation is less efficient than the direct damage by UVC
radiation for microorganism inactivation, the damage by UVA is believed to be irreparable,
whereas the damage by UVC is reparable through DNA-repair mechanisms (Oguma et al., 2013,
Xiong and Hu, 2013). UV damage by low-pressure mercury lamps, which emit UVC radiation at
254 nm, can be repaired relatively easily, but UV damage induced by medium-pressure mercury
lamps, which produce UVC and UVA radiation together, is difficult to repair (Oguma et al.,
2002, Zimmer and Slawson, 2002). Therefore, the prevention of microorganism self-repair
would be an advantage of UVA radiation for microorganism inactivation. Furthermore, UVA
radiation has higher penetrability and can penetrate farther into the solution for a better
disinfection of turbid water and wastewater (Chevremont et al., 2012a, Mori et al., 2007).
UVA radiation alone is less efficient for disinfection, but UVA radiation coupled with TiO2
could efficiently produce reactive oxygen species for microorganism inactivation (Marugan et al.,
2010). Because UVA-LEDs have high output power, they are desirable for photocatalytic
disinfection with TiO2. An interesting phenomenon called “residual disinfecting effect” was
reported, in which further inactivation of E. coli was observed after a photocatalytic process
using a combination of UVA-LEDs and TiO2 (Xiong and Hu, 2013). The mechanism for residual
disinfecting effect was proposed to be the cumulative damage of cellular components by reactive
oxygen species or stable oxidants, such as H2O2, which could prevent the reproduction of
damaged microorganisms (Pablos et al., 2013, Rincon and Pulgarin, 2004, 2007, Shang et al., 2009).
Many studies have been conducted on microorganism inactivation mechanisms using
different wavelengths, including UVC and UVA, with a focus on the effect on DNA damage.
However, there is little information in the literature on DNA damage and inactivation
mechanisms using a combination of different UV wavelengths (Nakahashi et al., 2014). Because
a few studies have reported the synergistic effect of combining particular wavelengths
(Chevremont et al., 2012a, Nakahashi et al., 2014), identifying the mechanisms is essential.
Chevremont et al. (2012a) argued that coupled wavelengths combined two UV properties: UVC
induces direct damage on DNA, but such DNA damage can be repaired by enzyme photolyase,
whereas the oxidative damage to bacterial membranes by UVA cannot be repaired. The research
on an oxidative DNA product, 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), which was induced by
UVA alone, and a thymine dimer, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), which was induced by
UVC alone, suggested that the combination of UVA and UVC suppressed one or more recovery
systems for DNA damage, such as CPDs, and oxidative stress from UVAs may play a key role in
this synergistic effect (Nakahashi et al., 2014). It is proposed that the coupled wavelengths of
UVA and UVC may also reduce reactivation after exposure due to the combined effects of two
types of UV wavelengths (Chevremont et al., 2012a).
The mechanism of pulsed UV illumination by xenon lamps with high energy and a broad
spectrum has been widely studied for inactivation and food decontamination. Yet, its effect is not
well understood, and there is little research on pulsed illumination by UV-LEDs. Pulsed UV
illumination has more instantaneous energy than continuous UV illumination (Li et al., 2010),
and additional inactivation mechanisms have been proposed, including photochemical,
photothermal, and photophysical effects (Elmnasser et al., 2007). Other than DNA damage by
UV, it is believed that pulsed UV treatment can prevent DNA repair due to inactivation of the
DNA-repair system and other enzymatic functions (Elmnasser et al., 2007). The UV pulse with
more instantaneous energy may lead to localized overheating and membrane destruction
(Krishnamurthy et al., 2007). Furthermore, the repeated and constant disturbance from high
intensity pulses could induce cell structure damage such as cell wall rupture, membrane damage,
and cellular content leakage (Krishnamurthy et al., 2010). As a result of these additional effects,
pulsed UV illumination is reported to be 4 to 6 times faster than continuous UV illumination for
equivalent inactivation levels (Fine and Gervais, 2004). These proposed mechanisms are mainly
based on studies of xenon lamps pulsed UV illumination with high energy and a broad spectrum.
Due to the different pulses generated by xenon lamps and UV-LEDs, the applicability of these
mechanisms for UV-LED pulsed illumination still needs further examination.

The research on water disinfection by newly emerging UV-LEDs is limited. Because UV-
LEDs are believed to be a promising alternative to traditional UV mercury lamps (Muramoto et
al., 2014), more research is required to better understand the application of UV-LEDs for water
disinfection. Further, some unique features of UV-LEDs such as wavelength diversity and pulsed
illumination and their effects on microorganism inactivation must be explored and understood.
Given that UV-LEDs are compact and the radiation patterns, such as emission wavelength,
viewing angle, and radiation distribution, are adjustable, they can enable creative reactor designs
through the optimization of flow and radiation distribution, as well as reactor geometry and
kinetics (Taghipour, 2013). The following are a few suggested areas for further investigation:
1) UV-LED characterization and a standard protocol for microorganism inactivation are
necessary to obtain reliable quantitative information on the effectiveness of UV-LEDs.
Specifically, a standard method for UV-dose determination of UV-LEDs is essential for
accurate and reliable UV dose-response data, which can be compared among different
studies.
2) Multiple wavelengths and pulsed illumination by UV-LEDs can have significant
impacts on inactivation effectiveness, but more studies are required for the fundamental
understanding of these phenomena, as well as determining the optimal condition.
3) The additional inactivation mechanisms by different wavelength combinations and
pulsed illumination require further investigation, which could lead to the design of more
efficient disinfection systems using tailored combinations of selected wavelengths and
pulsation modes by UV-LEDs.
4) Research on reactor designs for UV-LED water disinfection system is highly
encouraged for the practical application of this technology. The unique characteristics of
UV-LEDs compared to traditional UV mercury lamps, such as compactness, portability,
robustness, wavelength diversity, and pulsed illumination, provide flexible and diverse
options for novel reactor designs, which could also open the door to new applications of
UV-LED reactors.

Newly emerging UV-LEDs provide a promising alternative for water disinfection due to
many advantages over traditional mercury lamps. The comparison of microorganism response to
UV-LEDs and conventional UV lamps reveals that some microorganisms may be sensitive to
different UV sources, likely due to the difference in the UV source radiation patterns and the
fluence rates. Inactivation studies of several microorganisms using UV-LED of the same
wavelengths and comparable fluence rates, however, still show considerable discrepancies
among published results. The inconsistent and incomparable reported results on water
disinfection by UV-LEDs along with the substantial differences between UV-LEDs and UV
lamps highlight the importance and necessity of having a standard protocol for UV-LED
microbial inactivation studies, especially a standard method for UV-dose determination using
UV-LEDs.
The unique characteristics of UV-LEDs, particularly multiple wavelengths and pulsed
illumination, could improve inactivation effectiveness under optimal conditions. However, the
influencing factors and mechanisms involved need to be further investigated for a more efficient
application of UV-LEDs. The special features of UV-LEDs as small-point UV sources with
adjustable radiation patterns provide great flexibility for novel reactor designs and new
applications. The design of new UV-LED reactors, however, has to be performed taking into
account three phenomena: the reactor hydrodynamics, radiation distribution, and kinetics. Each
of these phenomena may be implemented with a higher degree of freedom using UV-LEDs as
the radiation source compared to UV lamps.

UV light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) with peak emissions at 265, 280 and 310 nm were applied to batch and flow-

Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure is one of the disinfection options in
water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants and wastewater
reclamation facilities for reuse [1–3]. In practice, UV disinfection may
serve alone or in combination with other unit processes. Combination
of UV with membrane filtration is good because, when UV precedes
membrane, the UV can suppress biofouling in the subsequent mem-
brane system [4–8]. Meanwhile, if UV follows membrane filtration,
the UV can serve as one of the multi-barriers to make the whole system
more robust, such as that adopted in the NEWater project in Singapore
[9].
Recently, UV light emitting diodes (LEDs), based on aluminium gal-
lium nitride (AlGaN) alloys, have become commercially available with
germicidal peak emissions in the range of 265–365 nm. Although, at
present, such AlGaN-based UV-LEDs suffer from low energy efficiency
and short lifetime, technology development in the near future could
potentially make UV-LEDs more feasible in practice [10]. UV-LEDs
would allow novel and flexible design of UV disinfection devices be-
cause they are free of mercury, robust against shocks, and very small
with a typical area of about 1 mm2
.
Several studies have examined the inactivation efficiency of UV-
LEDs in water [10–12]. UV-LEDs emit light at a specific peak wavelength
with a narrow bandwidth, which allows for flexible selection and com-
bination of specific wavelengths on demand. Chevremont et al. [13,14]
developed a batch reactor equipped with UV-LEDs with different
peak emissions. They concluded that the coupled wavelengths of
280/365 nm and 280/405 nm could synergistically enhance the in-
activation efficiency of pure cultured strains of Escherichia coli and
Enterococcus faecalis as well as indigenous fecal indicator bacteria
in the treated wastewater, based on the inactivation efficiency per
unit exposure time. However, the UV inactivation kinetics follows
a first-order model [15,16] between fluence and log inactivation,
where the fluence (or occasionally termed UV dose) is given as the
product of irradiance and exposure time. Namely, time-based evalu-
ations are highly dependent on the irradiance and would not be the
best approach to examine spectral effects of UV-LEDs, because the
output power of UV-LEDs differs substantially for different peak emis-
sions. Moreover, time-based efficiency is not comparable among UV re-
actors operated at different irradiances, which hinders generalization of
the outcomes. Thus, fluence-based evaluations are needed to compare
UV-LEDs with different peak emissions, either illuminated separately
or in combination, and to compare reactors operated at different irradi-
ances. In the meantime, the time required for treatment is a concern as
an operating parameter in practice. Therefore, it would be preferable to
conduct both time-based and fluence-based analyses for the evaluation
of UV-LED disinfection systems.
The determination of fluences under a polychromatic light source,
such as a combined emission of UV-LEDs, is more complicated than
in the case with monochromatic source, mostly because of the different
germicidal effectiveness at different emission wavelengths. To take such
germicidal factors into consideration, the UV absorbance spectrum of
DNA or the action spectra of test organism has been used as a weighting
factor [17–21]. The DNA-based weighting has been accepted to approx-
imate the action spectra of microorganisms because the genome DNA or
RNA is the main target of UV light to cause bactericidal effects in the
wavelength range of about 200–315 nm [22].
Studies on flow-through UV-LED reactors are still very limited [10,23],
although a flow-through operation would broaden the range of applica-
tion in practice. Wurtele et al. [23] showed a fluence-response curve of
Bacillus subtilis spores in a flow-through reactor using UV-LEDs emitting
at 282 nm. They developed a unique one-pass flow-through channel
module (6 mm wide and 5 mm deep) and operated it at a flow rate
of less than 12 mL/min in laminar flow. Such a low flow rate in a
very thin channel was required to compensate for the low output
power of the UV-LEDs with the prolonged UV exposure time. How to in-
crease the treatment capacity would be a concern to make the system
more practical.
Studies on the design of UV-LED reactors are of particular impor-
tance for practical applications. In that context, the effects of emission
wavelengths and mode of operation (batch or flow-through) need
to be elucidated further. Flexibility in the combination of different
emissions on demand is one of the unique features of UV-LEDs, but
combined emissions have not yet been examined in a flow-through
UV-LED reactor.
Based on the background above, the challenges of this study were to
apply UV-LEDs to batch and flow-through water disinfection systems
and to evaluate the disinfection efficiencies of E. coli. UV-LEDs with
peak emissions at 265, 280 and 310 nm were tested separately or in
combination. We determined both time-based and fluence-based inac-
tivation efficiencies and compared the performance between reactors
and among emissions. Based on the experimental data, we derived im-
plications for the future application of UV-LEDs to water disinfection
systems.

2.1. UV-LED apparatus
Two experimental setups were developed, batch and flow-through
reactors, using UV-LEDs with nominal peak emissions at 265, 280 and
310 nm (DOWA Electronics Materials, Japan). In both reactors, the elec-
tronic circuit was connected to a power supply (KK-100H, Takasago),
and each UV-LED was operated with a constant forward current of
20 mA. The forward voltage of each UV-LED at 20 mA was 9.5, 8.0
and 6.1 V for the 265, 280 and 310 nm UV-LEDs respectively. The
nominal optical output power of each UV-LED at 20 mA was 0.7, 1.3
and 1.1 mW for the 265, 280 and 310 nm UV-LEDs, respectively. The
emission spectrum of each UV-LED is shown in Fig. 1, as determined by
a spectroradiometer (Model USB2000, Ocean Optics). The full width at
half maximum was 9–10 nm for all UV-LEDs.
The batch reactor contained an array of nine UV-LEDs, which
consisted of three rows of three UV-LEDs in a 10 mm square array
(Fig. 2). All nine UV-LEDs on one array emitted with a single wave-
length, either at 265, 280 or 310 nm, and the emissions were not com-
bined for different wavelengths in the batch experiment. The array was
fixed facedown, 17.0 mm above the surface of a sample (10 mL) placed
in a sterilized Petri dish (34.5 mm in the inner diameter). The samples
were stirred magnetically throughout the UV exposures.
The flow-through reactor contained three rectangular arrays (9.5 mm
in width, 165 mm in length), and each array mounted ten UV-LEDs of
a single wavelength, either at 265, 280 or 310 nm, with a spacing of
10 mm each between UV-LEDs. The three arrays were bundled to build
an equilateral triangular prism having thirty UV-LEDs in total, which
was put into a quartz sleeve (16 mm in the outer diameter) and im-
mersed in the center of a cylinder (40 mm in the inner diameter)
(Fig. 3a). Each three-array module could be operated independently,
and each emission could be operated separately (265, 280 or 310 nm)
or in combination (265/280, 280/310, 265/310 or 265/280/310 nm).
Samples were circulated in the reactor at a flow rate of 385 mL/min
(Fig. 3b). The total volume of the flow-through system, including connec-
tion tubes and sampling port, was 400 mL, and the inner volume of the
UV-LED cylinder was 160 mL, excluding the volume of the quartz sleeve
placed in the center.

2.3. Biodosimetry
The germicidal fluence in the batch and flow-through reactors was
determined by biodosimetry following the UV Disinfection Guidance
Manual of the United States Environmental Protection Agency method
[21] using F-specific RNA bacteriophage Qβ as the challenge microor-
ganism [24].
Pure-cultured Qβ were spiked into 40 mL of sterilized PBS at 106
plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL, which was placed into a Petri dish
(85 mm in the inner diameter) and subjected to UV exposure using a
collimated beam apparatus containing a low-pressure UV lamp (GL15,
K. Oguma et al. / Desalination 328 (2013) 24–30
18 mm
15 W, Toshiba). The irradiance, E0 (mW/cm2), at 254 nm at the sample
surface was determined using a calibrated UV radiometer and detector
(UVR-2 UD25, Topcon), which was subsequently converted to the aver-
age irradiance in the dish, Eavg (mW/cm2), following the method by
Bolton and Linden [25]. Briefly, Eavg is given by the equation as follows:
Eavg

air and water at the wavelength of λ (nm), and WFλ is the water factor
to correct for the decrease in irradiance at λ due to absorbance of light
by the sample solution. Namely, WFλ is defined by the Beer–Lambert
law as follows:
WFλ ¼
1−10−aλ d
ln 10 ð Þaλd
where aλ (cm−1) is the absorption coefficient at λ and d (cm) is the
depth of sample in the dish. The absorption coefficient of the working
solution was determined with a 1 cm quartz cell using UV–vis spectro-
photometer (U-2000, Hitachi). The RF254 is 0.975 [25] and the PF, DF and
WF254 were 0.985, 0.988 and 0.968, respectively, in the current study.
Subsequently, the Eavg was multiplied with the exposure time, t (s),
to obtain the fluence (mJ/cm2) delivered into the Petri dish, and the
fluence-response curve for Qβ was determined as shown in Fig. 4.
Based on the slope for a regression line determined by the least square
method (r2 = 0.992 for three independent experiments with thirteen
data), the fluence required for 1 log inactivation of Qβ was determined
to be 13.3 mJ/cm2 at 254 nm. Using this fluence-response profile as a
reference, the reduction equivalent fluence at 254 nm (REF254) deliv-
ered in the batch and flow-through UV-LED reactors was back calculated
based on the log inactivation of Qβ.
Subsequently, the REF254 values were further corrected to obtain
the fluence at the wavelength of λ, which is termed“adjusted fluence”
hereafter, following the biodosimetry protocol proposed for the poly-
chromatic medium-pressure mercury UV lamp [18,25] with some mod-
ifications as follows.
Among the above-mentioned correction factors, RFλ and WFλ are
wavelength dependent. However, RFλ is assumable constant in the UV
range [25], and WFλ of working solution was almost constant at emis-
sions adopted in this study. Thus, these factors were not corrected for
the UV-LED emissions.
Meanwhile, the difference in the germicidal effectiveness at different
wavelengths was corrected using a germicidal factor (GFλ) indicating
the germicidal effectiveness at the wavelength λ in relative to that at
254 nm. The GFλ values were determined as 0.95, 0.56 and 0.03 at 265,
280 and 310 nm, respectively, based on the absorbance spectrum of
DNA [22].
To consider the difference in the output power for UV-LEDs at differ-
ent peak emission, a weighting factor wλ is defined as follows,
wλi
¼
pλi
Xn
i¼1Pλi
where n is the number of combined emissions and Pλ is the radiant
power of UV-LED for the emission at λ. The Pλ value was 7.7, 20.6 and
10.5 mW for 265, 280 and 310 nm, respectively, in the flow-through
reactor containing 10 UV-LED chips for each wavelength, as measured
by the UV-LED manufacture.
Finally, the REF254 is converted to the adjusted fluence for the emis-
sion wavelength at λ, Fλ, as follows,
Fλ ¼
Xn
:
i¼1wλi
GFλi
Given that n = 1, the Fλ for a single wavelength emission is simpli-
fied as follows:

2.5. Data analysis
In the UV inactivation kinetics, the log inactivation and fluence are
linearly related as described by a first-order model [15,16]. Because
fluence is the product of irradiance and exposure time, the log inactiva-
tion is also linearly related to the exposure time when the irradiance is
constant throughout the exposure.
Based on this theoretical background, three inactivation rate con-
stants were defined to evaluate the inactivation efficiency of UV-LED sys-
tems with different peak emissions. The time-based inactivation rate
constants, or time efficiencies of inactivation, are defined as k1 (s−1)
for the batch reactor and k2 (min−1) for the flow-through reactor
as follows,
log (N0/Nt1) = k1t1
log (N0/Nt2) = k2t2
where log (N0/Nt) is the log inactivation, N0 is the number of CFU
before UV exposure, Nt1 and Nt2 are the number of CFU at times t1
and t2, respectively, t1 is the UV exposure time in the batch reactor
and t2 is the operation time of the flow-through reactor. The rate
constants k1 and k2 have been defined separately, since these values
are not directly comparable because of the different definitions of
time in the batch and flow-through operations.
The fluence-based inactivation rate constant k3 (cm2/mJ) indicates
the fluence efficiency of inactivation, which was calculated for the
batch and flow-through reactors in the same manner as follows:
log (N0/Nt) = k3Fλ
where Fλ is the adjusted fluence at λ as defined above.
We did not define an offset value, or the intercept in the inactivation
kinetics because E. coli IFO 3301 does not show a shoulder in the
fluence-response curve [27]. The k value was obtained as the slope for
a regression line determined by the least square method. Data in the
tailing region were omitted for the calculation of the k values.
For the statistical analysis of the k1 and k2 values, a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare differences in means of k
values of each plot among emissions, and a Sheffe post hoc test was
used to identify which pairs of samples were significantly different.
For the analysis of the k3 values, a two-way ANOVA was used to com-
pare differences in means of k3 values of each plot between the reactors
and among emissions, followed by a Sheffe post hoc test to specify the
pairs with significant differences. Furthermore, the differences in k3
values between single and combined emissions were compared using
a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnet's post hoc test. The SPSS©
Statistics ver. 18 was used for the statistical analysis.

The inactivation curves of E. coli based on the exposure time and
adjusted fluence are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. In Fig. 6, the
adjusted fluence for 310 nm could not be determined in the flow-
through reactor because Qβ was not inactivated under that condition
even after 1 h of operation.
Comparing the reactors, the batch reactor showed log-linear inactiva-
tion throughout the exposure, while the flow-through reactor showed
tailing at high fluences, regardless of the emission wavelengths. Tailing
may have arisen from the aggregation of microorganisms [28,29] be-
cause the flow-through reactor required a longer time of operation
than the batch reactor and therefore provided higher possibility for
microbial aggregation.
Comparing the emissions, the UV-LED emitting at 310 nm required
an adjusted fluence of 56.9 mJ/cm2 to achieve 0.6 log inactivation of
E. coli in the batch reactor, and thus was much less effective than the
UV-LEDs emitting at 265 and 280 nm. The low germicidal effectiveness
at 310 nm is attributable to the much lower germicidal effectiveness at
310 nm than the others [22]. The UV-LEDs emitting at 265 nm achieved
over 4 log inactivation of E. coli at an adjusted fluence of 10.8 mJ/cm2 in
the batch reactor, and the value was 16.4 mJ/cm2 in the flow-through
reactor. Similarly, the UV-LEDs at 280 nm achieved about 4 log inactiva-
tion at 13.8 and 25.5 mJ/cm2 in the batch and flow-through reactors,
respectively.
The k1, k2 and k3 values are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the
time-based efficiencies, k1 in the batch reactor was highest at 280 nm
followed by the value at 265 nm and lowest at 310 nm, and differences
among emissions were statistically significant (p b 0.001). Similarly in
the flow-through reactor, k2 was higher in the order of 280 N 265 N
310 nm, and the differences were significant (p b 0.001). The highest
time-based efficiency at 280 nm is attributed to the highest output
power of the 280 nm UV-LED among the others. For currently available
UV-LEDs with substantial decrease in the output power below 280 nm,
the output power would be a critical determinant factor in the time-
based efficiency. Interestingly, the k2 values of the combined emissions
were lower than the summation of k2 values of the component emis-
sions applied separately. This suggests that combining emissions at
different wavelengths was not beneficial in the current study in the
time-based efficiency.
Comparing the fluence-based efficiencies, the k3 value at 265 nm
was significantly higher than the others in both batch and flow-
through reactors (p b 0.001), which is attributable to the highest UV
absorbance of DNA at 265 nm among the others [22]. A significant dif-
ference was observed between the batch and flow-through reactors in
the k3 values for emissions at 265 and 280 nm (p b 0.001), indicating
the deterioration of fluence-based efficiency in the flow-through reac-
tor, as compared to the batch reactor. The decrease in k3 values from
the batch to flow-through reactor was about 29% for 265 nm and 32%
for 280 nm. Lower inactivation efficiency in continuous flow systems
than in batch tests was reported in earlier studies using mercury UV
lamps ([30] for review), and such reduction may partially arise from
the heterogeneous hydraulic condition in the flow-through reactor.
In the flow-through reactor, the emissions at combined wavelengths
resulted in lower k3 values than the emissions at a single wavelength.
Namely, combined emissions were less efficient than each component
emission illuminated separately in the fluence-based analysis, as was
observed in the time-based evaluation. The k3 at 265/280 nm was sig-
nificantly lower than that at 265 nm (p b 0.001), though the difference
in k3 values between 265/280 nm and 280 nm was statistically insignif-
icant (p N 0.05).

To our knowledge, this is the first report applying biodosimetry to
evaluate UV-LED disinfection systems. This approach allowed a direct
comparison between batch and flow-through reactors and among dif-
ferent peak emissions of UV-LEDs.
The preference for batch or flow-through mode of operation would
be dependent on how and where to use the UV-LED apparatus, but
comparison between these two systems is meaningful to understand
UV-LED water disinfection systems and consider feasible applications
in practice. How to minimize tailing and reduction in efficiency would
be a key to apply UV-LEDs to water disinfection systems under flow-
through operation.
Among the emissions, the time-based efficiency was highest for the
280 nm UV-LED while the fluence-based efficiency was highest for the
265 nm UV-LED. This finding is in accordance with an earlier study
comparing UV-LEDs emitting at 280 nm and 269 nm in the inactivation
efficiency of B. subtilis spores [23]. This result would be useful in
selecting UV-LEDs for water disinfection systems.
According to the Second Law of Photochemistry, photochemical
events at different wavelengths should be independent of each other.
So, in theory, the results for combined emissions should be the sum of
the results for each emission alone, unless any photooxidative reactions
exert additional effects. Thus, any deviation from the additive law, as
was observed in the combined cases in this study, must arise from ex-
perimental conditions as discussed below.
We observed a decrease in the inactivation efficiency for combined
emissions, while Chevremont et al. [13,14] reported synergistic in-
activation effects of coupled wavelengths. This discrepancy could have
arisen from three possible reasons: difference in the microorganisms,
difference in the emission wavelengths for combination, and difference
in the reactor design. First possibility is the difference in the target
microorganisms between this study (E. coli K12 IFO 3301) and their
study (E. coli ATCC 11303, ATCC 15597, CIP 6224; E. faecalis ATCC 19433,
ATCC 33186; indigenous bacteria in treated wastewater), because the
degree of synergistic effects was reported different among species and
strains [14].
Second possible reason is the difference in the emission wavelengths,
because we combined emissions in the range of UVC (180–280 nm) and
UVB (280–315 nm) while Chevremont et al. [13,14] combined UVC and
UVA (315–400 nm). It is known that the bactericidal effects of UVC and
UVB are similarly based on the formation of genomic damage that are
reparable by DNA repair mechanisms, while UVA inactivates microor-
ganisms by promoting the formation of active species to cause diverse
irreparable damage in the cell [31]. In the past studies using mercury
lamps, a polychromatic medium-pressure UV lamp, emitting UVA
together with UVC and UVB, was better than a monochromatic
low-pressure UV lamp emitting solely at UVC, regarding the finally-
achievable inactivation efficiency of E. coli after DNA repair mecha-
nisms were completed [27,32]. Therefore, if DNA repair mechanisms
were playing roles in the experiment, the results would be different
with or without UVA for inactivation. We minimized the possibility
of unexpected photoreactivation by handling samples in the dark
condition, but so-named dark repair was unavoidable.
The above two possible reasons would explain the difference be-
tween synergistic and non-synergistic (additive) effects but may not
reasonably explain the reduced inactivation efficiency for the combined
wavelengths. Therefore, we consider the third possible reason for the
discrepancy: difference in the reactor design. We illuminated 10 UV-
LEDs for each emission wavelength (Fig. 3), while Chevremont et al.
[13,14] used a single UV-LED chip for each emission. In general,
AlGaN-based UV-LEDs generate more heat than visible LEDs because
of the higher operation voltage and lower radiative efficiency. More-
over, it is well documented that the output power of UV-LEDs decreases
substantially with increasing temperature [33–35]. Therefore, com-
bined emissions, illuminating 20 or 30 UV-LEDs simultaneously in a
thin quartz sleeve, may have generated more waste heat than a single
emission illuminating 10 UV-LEDs and eventually impaired the output
power for each UV-LED in the current study. To strengthen this hypoth-
esis, the output power for combined emissions was tested, resulting in
the lower output power of about 8% for each UV-LED in combined
cases, as compared to the emission illuminated separately. This is not
a direct evidence showing that waste heat was causing the output
power reduction, but considered together with the references [33–35],
we assume that it may have occurred in the current study. This assump-
tion implies the importance of the configuration of UV-LEDs and the
way to deal with waste heat in scaling up UV-LED reactors for practical
applications.

Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection is an early discovered technology that is currently and widely used for water treatment and food hygiene treatment. A newly emerging technology of UV disinfection, that is, UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs), has aroused considerable research attention. UV-LEDs feature numerous advantages compared with traditional UV mercury vapor lamps and are expected to replace traditional UV lamps. Researchers currently perform studies to obtain data and develop methods for UV-LED water treatment systems. This article analyzes the latest research status and discusses the types of inactivation factors, such as the wavelength selectivity of UV light source, control of UV dose, effect of inactivation rate constant (K) (cm²/mJ), working mode of water sample, external auxiliary system, and UV sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in water. The wavelengths of approximately 260 and 280 nm normally feature strong inactivation characteristics. When compared with the approximately 260 nm wavelength chip, the around 280 nm wavelength chip proves to be a better choice as its higher wavelength light power can result in faster disinfection capacity of bacteria. UV dose can also be used as the reference value for disinfection of drinking water, whereas the inactivation rate constant (K) (cm²/mJ) varies with different microorganism internal structures. Changing the working mode or adding an auxiliary system can also enhance the inactivation effect in water treatment system settings. In addition, we can compare the inactivation capacities of several pathogens as follows: ΦX174 > Escherichia coli > T type bacteriophage > Bacillus subtilis > MS2 or Qβ > human adenovirus. The in-depth investigation and discussion of inactivation factors and the mechanism of action in UV-LEDs water treatment systems will establish a more efficient UV-LED disinfection method in the future, provide a guiding direction, and promote the standardization and normalization of pathogen inactivation mechanism in UV-LED water treatment systems.

 The safety of drinking water remains an important issue worldwide, especially in most developing countries and numerous rural areas (Song et al., 2016). Drinking water is easily polluted by major pollutant sources such as biological pollutants, which include various pathogenic microorganisms, easily causing the spread and epidemic of water-borne diseases (Wang et al., 2009). Polluted drinking water will result in proliferation of various human enteric viruses, including hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, and norovirus. Human enteric viruses may cause severe diseases, such as hepatitis, poliomyelitis, and meningitis (Kim et al., 2017).

In 2000, the US Food and Drug Administration approved ultraviolet (UV) disinfection as an effective method that can inactivate the replication of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms in food, water, and beverages. UV disinfection is a chemical-free process, generates no byproducts, and hardly affects the nutritional values of food. Disinfection by UV radiation features no risk of overdosing, making it a viable method for water disinfection (Bowker et al., 2011; Kheyrandish et al., 2017a; Kim et al., 2017). UV irradiation has drawn considerable attention in water disinfection and food industries, especially in water treatment applications (Kim et al., 2017). UV disinfection has also been recommended as a substitute for chemical additives for surface water treatment according to a US Environmental Protection Agency report; it can effectively inactivate viruses at 4 log reduction in surface water in water disinfection systems (USEPA, 2006). To date, more than 7000 municipal UV disinfection installations exist worldwide (Muller, 2011), and small household UV disinfection systems are also available (Brownell et al., 2008). UV disinfection equipment from the global market is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2020 (Allied Analytics LLP, 2014).

Conventionally, UV light is generated from mercury lamps, including low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps, which emit nearly monochromatic UV light at a wavelength of 254 nm, and medium-pressure lamps (MP), which emit a polychromatic spectrum with various wavelengths (Bolton and Cotton, 2008). However, UV mercury lamps are packaged by glass, which is fragile. UV mercury lamps easily cause mercury spills in the external environment, releasing harmful vapors into the air for weeks or years. In recent years, a new friendly method was developed to generate UV light, that is, UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs). Vilhunen et al. (2009) used UV-LEDs at 269 and 276 nm wavelengths as an optimal method for bacterial disinfection; other studies also support that UV-LEDs can work effectively in disinfection. However, UV-LEDs feature drawbacks: the UV-LED chip is prone to lattice defects, difficult to develop, and features low internal light efficiency (Wang et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2017). The chip packaging is also prone to various problems, such as UV aging, internal interconnection failure, interface shedding, wire bonding failure, and light decay failure (Kheyrandish et al., 2017a, 2017b; Beck et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2016; Arik et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016a, 2016b), and notable challenges occur in the application mechanism research and development (R&D) design of encapsulated UV-LED products; these challenges include improving the performance of UVC-LED reactors, creating a predictive model that can predict the average fluence rate, and developing measurement techniques and accurate protocols for measuring and controlling the UV-LED output. Still, UV-LED chip R&D technology achieves continuous progress, although the epitaxial slice with a short wavelength is difficult to develop, and lattice failures within the chip are less manageable. Short wavelength development has also shown remarkable progress. Chips with wavelengths of below 280 nm have been developed, with 200 nm to 280 nm being the most useful disinfection bands. In addition, chip packaging module output efficiency is constantly improved in chip encapsulation mode, including single chips. The multiple-chip array module is also commonly used today; it remarkably improves the output power of the entire device. Disinfection application products made by UV-LED packaging constantly emerge in the market. UV-LEDs feature more advantages compared with UV mercury lamps in a number of ways; UV-LEDs possess an adjustable wavelength and can emit radiation from 210 nm up to visible light and are promising UV radiation sources (Shur and Gaska, 2010). UV-LEDs cause no disposal problem (mercury-free), leave a small footprint (flexible architecture), are mechanically robust, and possess an instant on–off functionality (high-frequency response), low voltage, low power requirements, and long lifetimes (reduced frequency of replacement) (Würtele et al., 2011).

UV-LEDs feature numerous advantages, but owing to the current overall technical difficulties, various aspects remain underdeveloped. Most UV-LED applications are still in the state of R&D, and no standard measurement scheme and description determine how UV-LEDs can achieve the disinfection mechanism. Meanwhile, the measurement technology of traditional mercury lamp has developed. As early as 2003, Bolton and Linden have developed a standardized protocol and obtained accurate and consistent results for microbiological and photochemical experiments by determining an accurate UV fluence (Bolton and Linden, 2003). A protocol was also developed for measuring UV mercury lamp output through researching different parameters (Sasges and Robinson, 2005). Later, more practical protocols were introduced, and different industry participants, including the International Ultraviolet Association, showed much interest (Lawal et al., 2008; Adam et al., 2010). However, these measurement protocols were developed for UV mercury lamps and were unsuitable for UV-LEDs, which possess different structures and output specifications (Kheyrandish et al., 2017a). Therefore, a measurement and analytic system for UV-LED must be launched. A number of scholars carried out studies on various aspects of UV-LED water treatment in recent years. Consequently, a standard protocol should be established to accurately control and monitor the output of UV-LEDs and assess the consistency of UV-LEDs with an accurate and reliable method in different experiments and devices; protocols must also be developed for measuring and controlling UV-LED output, radiation profile, radiant power, and UV dose for water disinfection applications (Kheyrandish et al., 2017a, 2017b; Simons et al., 2014). Other researchers investigated the synergistic effects of dual wavelength to compare log inactivation values (Beck et al., 2017; Chevremont et al., 2012b). Scholars also showed interest in adding auxiliary equipment, such as an ultrasonic pretreatment system, for achieving better antibacterial rate (Zhou et al., 2017; Andrej et al., 2014). Studies on disinfection of air surfaces, such as by an automatic disinfection stethoscope device made by UV-LED lamp, solved the problem on transmission of hospital pathogens through the stethoscope (Messina et al., 2015; Messina et al., 2016; Messina et al., 2018). The UV-LED system will improve gradually, but forming a comprehensive, standardized, and normalized UV-LED disinfection mechanism remains extremely urgent.

This article thoroughly analyzes the latest research status, with discussion by horizontal and vertical comparisons, and determines the interconnections among inactivation factors and the mechanism of action from the influence rule of UV-LED water treatment systems. We will conduct in-depth investigation and discussion to highlight the disinfection mechanism to gain insights into the related inactivation mechanism. As a result, researchers can expand the relevant design and research work in UV-LED water treatment systems. This paper also explores the methods of deep UV-LED disinfection for the establishment of a more efficient UV-LED disinfection technique in the future, provides a guiding direction, and promotes the standardization and normalization of pathogen inactivation mechanism in UV-LED water treatment systems.

People historically discovered DNA or RNA as the key target in various organisms; UV disinfection causes the death of organisms when their DNA or RNA absorbs UV light (Hijnen et al., 2006). Numerous studies were conducted on mutagenic DNA lesions induced by UV irradiation. According to microbiological experiments, mutagenic DNA lesions induced from UV irradiation belong to two major classes, namely, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts; although the possibly existing Dewar valence isomers are extremely low to count, CPDs are the most abundant and compose around 75% of UV-induced DNA damage products in mutagenic DNA lesion inducers (Sinha and Häder, 2002). Fig. 1 shows the construction and generative process of cyclobutane thymine pyrimidine dimers (Bolton and Cotton, 2008).

Maximum UV light absorption from DNA is reached at a wavelength of ~260 nm; however, in most cases, the absorption peak wavelength distribution, which varies among organisms, becomes dependent on the target organism (Bolton and Cotton, 2008; Chen et al., 2009). For example, Chen (2009) presented that Bacillus subtilis spores feature two absorption maxima: one below 240 nm and another around 270 nm. Cabaj et al. (2002) and Mamane and Linden (2005) obtained similar results and showed that the wavelength of fluence inactivation response curves totals 254 and 279 nm, respectively. Different target organisms exhibit different sensitivities under UV irradiation (Aoyagi et al., 2011). Although the genetic material of pathogens is either DNA or RNA, they also contain other components, such as proteins and a cell membrane. Thus, we should perform various analyses for complex organisms.

The action spectrum arises primarily from the DNA that absorbs UV photon and matches the relative absorbance of DNA extracted from an organism; for instance, the action spectrum of S. typhinium matches well with the relative absorbance of the DNA extracted from the organism (Chen et al., 2009). The absorbance of other components to photons, rather than the DNA in spores, are also non-negligible, as these components may be involved in the inactivation effect by germicidal UV light (Chen et al., 2009).

The formula of the first-order model of Chick–Watson (Hijnen et al., 2006) is described by Eq. (1):
Log (N0/N) = K * UV dose (1)
where N0 and N refer to the number of colonies (CFU/mL) before and after UV irradiation, respectively; UV dose (mJ/cm²) is the fluence at a given wavelength; K (cm²/mJ) is the proportional coefficient used to describe inactivation, that is, the inactivation rate constant (Li et al., 2017).

The time-based and fluence-based inactivation rate constants (K) by UV-LED for Escherichia coli are higher than those for other species, and their differences among viruses show statistical significance (Oguma et al., 2016). Considering the order of sensitivity among four microbial species, namely, E. coli K12 IFO3301, Qβ, MS2, and human adenoviruses (HAdV), E. coli is the most sensitive, whereas HAdV are the most resistant, similar to the order of sensitivities observed for an LP UV lamp in the work of Hijnen (Hijnen et al., 2006; Rattanakul et al., 2014; Oguma et al., 2016). However, UV sensitivity is distinguished in terms of the generic material, which can be single- (ssDNA) or double-stranded DNA and single- (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA, which is inherited by viruses, such as the ssDNA of ΦX174 viruses or ssRNA of MS2 and Qβ viruses. The UV sensitivity of viruses has also been evaluated by the inactivation rate constant (K) (cm²/mJ) (Hijnen et al., 2006; Song et al., 2016). MS2 and Qβ yield similar inactivation rate constants (K) (cm²/mJ) values and show no significant difference regardless of the kind of treatment condition. However, ΦX174 exhibits statistically high UV sensitivity and inactivation rate constant (Kim et al., 2017). Regarding the exploration of different species in terms of inactivation capacities or anti-UV ability, biological inactivation capacities, which mean the capacities of microorganism to be inactivated by UV light, must be compared. The exploration of each species in terms of the absorption wavelength will determine the optimum disinfection wavelength for each microorganism.

UV-LEDs comprise UVC (200–280 nm), UVB (280–315 nm), and UVA (315–400 nm). The inactivation mechanism of UVC irradiation is based on the absorption of UV photons from the genetic material and produces dimers that can inhibit the transcription and replication of genes from cells (Bolton and Linden, 2003; Oguma et al., 2002). However, most DNA repairs, including photoreactivation and dark repair, occur under low UV doses. In photoreactivation repair, which is the major process of DNA repair, photoenzymes are specifically identified as enzymes that can repair CPD dimers by absorbing light energy in the 310–480 nm wavelength (UVA or partial visible light); the dark repair, which requires no light, replaces damaged DNA nucleotides with undamaged DNA and causes minimal effects (Bolton and Cotton, 2008). Although UVA may undergo photoreactivation, recent results showed that UVA radiation mechanism can cause inactivation of microorganisms when coupling UVA and UVC (Chevremont et al., 2012a). Bactericidal effects from UVC and UVB may be similarly based on the formation of genomic damages, which are reparable by DNA repair mechanisms; on the other hand, UVA inactivates microorganisms, causing diverse irreparable damages in cells by promoting the formation of active species (Friedberg et al., 1995; Oguma et al., 2013). UVA radiation can destroy the cell membrane and other cellular components by producing hydroxyl and oxygen radicals to damage proteins (Chevremont et al., 2012a). DNA damage can be repaired by the enzyme photolyase with UVA radiation, but no reported evidence discusses the damage of bacterial membranes that can be repaired by UVA radiation.

Chevremont et al. (2012a) showed that coupling UVA and UVC can be more effective by using the germicidal effect of UVC and greater penetrating capability of UVA; this coupling increases the efficiency of microbial inactivation owing to the lack of possibility to repair the damage when bacterial membranes can be destroyed after UVA exposure (Chevremont et al., 2012a). UV-LEDs with wavelengths at the coupling range of UVA and UVC exhibit higher polyphenol oxidase inactivation efficiency than traditional LP mercury lamps. Compared with UVC irradiation and thermal treatment, UVC irradiation from the coupling wavelength by UVA and UVC achieved better color preservation of cloudy apple juice (Akgün and Ünlütürk, 2017). Furthermore, the light from UVA radiation, although not absorbed by DNA, can produce hydroxyl radicals to damage protein bacterial membranes and inactivate microorganisms (Chatterley, 2003; Chevremont et al., 2012b). UV dose is the most crucial factor regardless of whether using UVC, UVB, or UVA, whose effects remarkably differ at low UV doses. B. subtilis and Salmonella typhi undergo “shoulder” self-repair at low UVC doses (Chen et al., 2009). Low UVA radiation easily causes photoreactivation. Thus, we should develop a multivariate approach to specify the most influential factors of inactivation. Several factors affect inactivation yields; such factors include bacterial density, pH, UV exposure time, and the single wavelength or coupling wavelength of chips (Chevremont et al., 2012b). We will thoroughly analyze and discuss their mechanism of action.

UV emission light source system is the main factor affecting disinfection. According to the inactivation mechanism, disinfection of microorganisms in UV water treatment system prevents the replication and transcription of microbial genetic materials by absorbing UV photons and generating polymers. In UV water disinfection systems, the most common light source transmitter systems include traditional mercury lamps and emerging UV-LEDs. However, the large and bulky UV mercury lamp installation may be replaced by compactly structured UV-LEDs, which are very marketable and show promise owing to their small and flexible appearance. The UV-LED chip encapsulation features multiple packaging forms: single chip and multiple-chip array. Fig. 2 shows the UV-LED light source system comprising a basic circuit, power supply, and four UV-LED chips packaged in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 positions, respectively. The wavelength of UV-LED chips can be selected as needed. We can select chips with the same or different wavelengths for setting the UV-LED chip number or wavelength depending on the situation analysis.

In this part, we can analyze and subsequently determine the optimal light source, optimal efficiency, and disinfection effect of UV-LED water treatment disinfection systems.

Wavelength is a key factor in the microbial disinfection mechanism of UV systems. From the UV source disinfection, the wavelength of 253.7 nm can be assumed as the most effective when using traditional mercury lamps for disinfection (Bolton and Cotton, 2011). However, mercury lamps perform disinfection using two ways: LP and MP. MP is mixed with multiple emission peak wavelengths. Determining the most effective wavelength from MP presents difficulty. Emission peaks from LP concentrate at around 254 nm wavelength, whereas the optimal germicidal wavelength serves as the center wavelength at 253.7 nm (Bolton and Cotton, 2011). As UV-LEDs can emit light of adjustable wavelength and provide insights into the effect of wavelength on disinfection, the development of UV-LEDs will enable more qualitative analysis of microbial inactivation.

Regarding DNA absorbance relation curves, the wavelength at 260 nm exhibits the largest absorbance (Bolton and Cotton, 2008). However, in actual experiments on microorganism inactivation by UV-LEDs, different microbes showed different absorption curves, with each microorganism presenting inconsistent disinfection abilities. The absorbance values at 260 and 280 nm indicate strong inactivation characteristics. When the inactivation capacities of different microorganisms were compared in terms of UV dose response, the dose response per log inactivation of each species at the wavelength of ~260 nm was consistently less than that at 280 nm. For example, Bowker et al. (2011) observed that the dose responses per log inactivation for MS2 reached 26.07 and 28.57 mJ/cm² at wavelengths of 255 and 275 nm, respectively. Oguma and Surapong (2018) declared that a 265 nm wavelength yielded a lower dose response in per log inactivation of E. coli, B. subtilis spores, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Qβ than the 280 nm wavelength. Similarly, Beck et al. (2017) discovered that a 260 nm wavelength resulted in a lower dose response per log inactivation for B. subtilis, B. pumilus, and HAdV2 than the 280 nm wavelength. Among the tested wavelengths, the UV-LED wavelength of ~260 nm achieved the highest bacterial inactivation regardless of the bacterial species, as proven by the highest UV absorbance of nucleic acids at ~260 nm (Harm, 1980; Bolton and Cotton, 2008; Oguma and Surapong, 2018). However, we still cannot affirm that the 260 nm UV-LEDs result in more desirable disinfection benefits.

At the current level of technology, the 280 nm wavelength is an optimum choice to achieve high inactivation efficiency with minimum energy consumption. Oguma observed that the 280 nm UV-LEDs can achieve a high inactivation rate constant and feature the lowest energy consumption to achieve 3 log inactivation in the microbial species tested at 265, 280, and 300 nm (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). By comparing disinfection efficiencies, another group also noted that the 280 nm wavelength is more suitable than 255 nm for water purification systems because the power produced from the external quantum efficiency at 280 nm reached more than 10 times that obtained at 255 nm (Aoyagi et al., 2011). Würtele reported higher light power output and inactivation capacities at 282 nm than those at 269 nm. Although the 269 nm UV-LEDs exhibited better germicidal effectiveness, the 282 nm UV-LEDs caused significantly better spore inactivation for the same timespan and input power owing to the higher photon output (at the same current) of the 282 nm UV-LEDs (Würtele et al., 2011). In the range of the UV disinfection band, a higher wavelength light power can result in faster disinfection capacity of bacteria; lower wavelength peak values are close to DNA absorbance relation curves, but lower wavelength UV-LEDs are more effective when considering light power (Vilhunen et al., 2009). The selection of UV-LED wavelength shows potential for future applications in water disinfection systems equipped with UV-LEDs (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). Coupling wavelength has also been widely used in discussion in recent years; however, the obtained results vary, and the total power of coupling wavelength is inferior compared with the use of single-type UV-LEDs for disinfection; although further investigation is needed, other applications by wavelength combination yield better disinfection effect and optimize the advantages of different types of wavelength (Akgün and Ünlütürk, 2017).

     "paragraph": "UV dose",
     "summary": "",
    "text":"""
 UV dose is another key factor in UV-LED water disinfection systems. UV dose is not only directly produced by UV-LEDs but can also be affected by the settings of parameters and related instruments. UV dose is equal to the product of UV radiant flux, exposure time, attenuation factor, and radiating surface; the corresponding formula can be expressed as follows: UV dose = UV radiant flux * exposure time * attenuation factor / (radiating surface). In the formula, UV radiant flux, which is also known as radiant power, is defined as the radiant energy passing through a section in unit time when light radiates outward and is expressed in watts (W); UV dose is defined as the radiant energy received per unit area of receiving ionizing radiation (mJ/cm²) and represents the absorbed dose of the water sample from the UV transmitter to the water treatment reactor. This system involves complex attenuation factors, including water, reflection, divergence, and sensor factors (Bolton and Linden, 2003). Therefore, UV dose is not a real value but an approximation.

If we only control the UV radiation flux, the experimental results will significantly vary owing to the different radiation times, radiation distances, and intensities. LP features a high radiation flux rate when only the control dose is kept constant, but radiation time, radiation distance, and radiation intensity differ between LP and UV-LEDs (Würtele et al., 2011). LP emits a parallel light, whereas the UV-LED lamp is a point light source that emits a diffused light depending on the viewing angle. Different from LP, radiation intensity is defined as the radiant flux leaving the point source within a given direction cube in the UV-LED light source system. Considering the most influential factors, we control the equal UV radiation dose, where under a specific circumstance, the same attenuation factor is considered. Exposure time is closely associated with flux and dose, that is, a larger radiation flux will result in short exposure time. Furthermore, several researchers observed that high radiation flux and short exposure time may result in a higher logarithmic inactivation compared with low flux and long exposure time as prolonged exposure time may cause microbial aggregation, which leads to decreased inactivation (Song et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017). The higher effectiveness of 275 nm is also proposed to be more effective for E. coli inactivation in a higher fluence rate and shorter exposure time to reach the same UV dose than the combination of a lower fluence rate and longer exposure time owing to the higher output power from the 275 nm UV-LEDs (Bowker et al., 2011; Harm, 1980; Sommer et al., 1998). Thus, when we control the same UV radiation dose, a larger radiation flux may result in better disinfection effect. Various studies have also hypothesized that UV inactivation follows the Bunsen–Roscoe reciprocity law, which states that the photochemical effect depends only on the total energy dose, that is, the origin of exposure time and fluence rate (Murata and Osakabe, 2013). Sommer et al. (1998) have verified the existence of same log inactivation under the same product of fluence rate and exposure time when they have inactivated the bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174, and B40-8 by mercury UV lamps. They also observed that E. coli inactivation deviated from the reciprocity law and showed a higher log inactivation in a higher fluence rate and shorter exposure time than under a lower fluence rate and prolonged exposure time despite using the same total UV fluence (UV dose). This phenomenon could indicate that UV disinfection depends on both photochemical reactions and biological processes (Harm, 1980). Then, as the deviation from the Bunsen–Roscoe reciprocity law may occur on certain microorganisms, such as E. coli, the biological processes induced by UV radiation may vary with different microorganisms; thus, certain organisms may be more sensitive to the fluence rate compared with the others (Song et al., 2016). Meanwhile, a closer radiation distance causes larger radiation flux. However, the current investigations about radiation distance from UV emission sources to water surface are lacking. We probably cannot perform an in-depth research owing to the current technical level, which is still at the stage of close-range surface irradiation or near-surface water sample radiation of water-body experimental research. However, with increasing UV-LED external quantum power, radiation distance will soon become a focus of research, especially in the design of various products. The depth of water sample is discussed in several articles and is also the most important factor for UV transmittance. Therefore, setting of different parameters of water sample depth may yield different results in various systems.

First, when comparing the UV doses per log inactivation of different microorganisms, the same wavelength must be ensured. Table 1 shows the detailed analysis of each wave band, which can be used as a reference frame that estimates the UV dose for a specific logarithmic inactivation number. We can compare the inactivation capacities of different microorganisms from the UV dose response. At a wavelength of 255 nm, bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ present similar UV doses of 12.81 and 12.5 mJ/cm² for per log inactivation respectively, indicating the requirement for more UV dose to be inactivated compared with E. coli (3.33 mJ/cm²), T7 (5.13 mJ/cm²), and ΦX174 (1.73 mJ/cm²). The inactivation capacities of E. coli are higher than that of T7 but lower than that of ΦX174 (Bowker et al., 2011; Aoyagi et al., 2011). Similar results were achieved by Aoyagi et al. (2011), who showed the strong and weak resistances of MS2 and ΦX174, respectively, and almost the same inactivation capacities of MS2 and Qβ. At a wavelength of 260 nm, the dose responses per log inactivation of MS2 and HAdV2 reach 15.15 and 30.5 mJ/cm² respectively; thus, the inactivation capacities of MS2 are higher than that of HAdV2, as observed by integrated cell culture quantitative polymerase chain reaction, but lower than that of E. coli K12 (ATCC 29425), which requires 1.5 mJ/cm² dose responses per log inactivation (Beck et al., 2017). At a wavelength of 265 nm, the dose responses per log inactivation of Qβ, B. subtilis, and E. coli IFO 3301 total 39, 28, and 6 mJ/cm² respectively; thus, the inactivation capacities of B. subtilis are higher than that of Qβ but lower than that of E. coli IFO 3301 (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). At a wavelength of 266 nm, bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ show specific UV doses for per log inactivation at 1.29 mJ/cm², and their doses are higher than that of ΦX174, which requires a dose response per log inactivation of 0.14 mJ/cm² (Kim et al., 2017). At a wavelength of 275 nm, UV doses for per log inactivation from MS2, T7, and E. coli reach 28.57, 4.26, and 2.37 mJ/cm², respectively; thus, the inactivation capacities of T7 are below that of MS2 and lower than that of E. coli (Bowker et al., 2011). Furthermore, at 280 nm, the inactivation capacities can be compared as follows: ΦX174 > E. coli > B. subtilis > MS2 or Qβ > HAdV2 (Aoyagi et al., 2011; Oguma et al., 2013; Beck et al., 2017; Oguma and Surapong, 2018). In LP environment, the inactivation capacities are ordered as follows: E. coli K12 IFO 3301 > T1 > B. subtilis > MS2 > HAdV2 (Rodriguez et al., 2014). In summary, according to the UV dose response for per log inactivation in the same wavelength, inactivation capacities can be compared as follows: ΦX174 > E. coli > T type bacteriophage > B. subtilis > MS2 or Qβ > HAdV. After discerning the inactivation capacities of different microorganisms and the most effective wavelength, experimental model, or amount of UV dose, scholars also conducted considerable relevant research.

We also observed the correlation of UV dose and wavelength. A chip with a short wavelength is difficult to develop and costly but features low optical efficiency. Owing to their high Al content and significantly lower quantum efficiency, UV-LEDs with short wavelengths are substantially more difficult to fabricate than UV-LEDs with longer wavelengths; furthermore, UV-LEDs with lower quantum efficiencies produce lower optical power outputs than those generated by UV-LEDs with longer wavelengths at the same drive current (Aoyagi et al., 2011). Hence, encapsulation modules, which consist of short wavelength chips, possess a low radiation power (radiant flux). UV dose is directly related to radiant flux and is thus also related to the wavelength value. Therefore, the influence of UV dose must be analyzed in combination with wavelength to analyze the least energy consuming and more promising wavelengths and the bactericidal effect of UV dose under different wavelengths. According to relevant studies and discussions, the best wavelengths are those at 260 and 280 nm, which feature the highest efficiency and lowest energy consumption or electrical energy.

The electrical energy per order, EEO (kWh/m³), is a parameter based on electrical energy consumption, which has been used to assess the performance of different UV disinfection systems (i.e., UV-LEDs and LPUV). EEO is defined as the amount of electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of microbes by an order of magnitude in a specified volume of water (Oguma and Surapong, 2018), and it can be calculated by Eq. (2) (Sharpless and Linden, 2005):

EEO = A / (3.6 * 10³ * V * K * C * WF) (2)

where EEO is the electrical energy per order of magnitude (kWh/m³/order), A is the irradiant surface area (cm²), V is the volume of sample (mL), K is the fluence-based inactivation rate constant (cm²/mJ), WF is the water factor accounting for the UV absorbance and water depth, and the value of 3.6 * 10³ is a unit conversion constant for mW and kW, s and h, and mL and m³; and C is the wall plug efficiency which can be calculated by Eq. (3) (Oguma and Surapong, 2018):

C = Poutput / Pinput = FA / (IA * VA) (3)

where Poutput refers to the UV-LED optical power (mW), Pinput denotes the applied electrical power (mW), IA represents the applied current (mA), VA corresponds to the applied voltage (V), and FA is the radiant flux (mW) information provided by the manufacturer.

The UV dose (mJ/cm²) required for obtaining n-log reduction, that is, the electrical energy per specific n-log10 reduction, EE.n (kWh/m³/n-log reduction), is defined in Eq. (4) (Beck et al., 2017):

EE.n = A * Fn / (3.6 * 10³ * V * C * WF) (4)

where Fn is the fluence required for n-log10 reduction (mJ/cm²).

Beck et al. (2017) calculated the EE.3 value for E. coli inactivation at 280 nm and observed a lower value (1.04 kWh/m³) compared with that at 260 nm (1.392 kWh/m³); the EE.2 values observed for HAdV2 inactivation at 280 and 260 nm measured 4.401 and 5.143 kWh/m³, respectively. Oguma and Surapong (2018) observed that the EE.3 values at 280 nm UV-LEDs were lower than those at 265 nm as the difference in wall plug efficiency consumed approximately half as much energy as 265 nm UV-LEDs for all microorganisms; they also discovered that the EE.3 values of all tested microorganisms at 300 nm were the highest among the wavelengths, as proven by the highest wall plug efficiency at 300 nm in the tested UV-LEDs. In brief, the 280 nm UV-LED is an optimum choice to achieve high inactivation efficiency in low-energy consumption conditions.

The change in experimental models is also connected with UV dose. To achieve 4 log inactivation, researchers created a set of experimental models of batch and flow-through reactors. The batch reactor contained an array of nine UV-LEDs on the surface of a sample placed in a sterilized Petri dish, whereas the flow-through reactor contained connection tubes, a sampling port, and the UV-LED cylinder, which was protected by a quartz sleeve and placed in the center. The UV-LEDs with 265 nm wavelength must be adjusted to fluence values of 10.8 and 16.4 mJ/cm², but those with 280 nm wavelength must be adjusted to fluences of 13.8 and 25.5 mJ/cm² in the batch and flow-through reactors, respectively (Oguma et al., 2013). Different UV doses are required for different experimental model settings at the same wavelength. A predictive model equation was designed to evaluate the viral inactivation effect; this equation can calculate the specific irradiation UV dose for accomplishing the expected inactivation levels in water treatment facilities (Kim et al., 2017). The experimental model of flow reactor yields better predictions; as the flux or UV dose increases, the flow model for decentralized and mobile water disinfection systems will produce higher inactivation, improve light output, and reduce costs in the form of mobile water disinfection systems in the future (Würtele et al., 2011).

Overall, the amount of UV dose that can achieve an optimum disinfection effect must be determined, thus requiring extensive investigations.

    The inactivation rate constant (K) (cm2/mJ) is equal to the sensitivity of microorganisms to UV light. First, inactivation of different microorganisms must be perceived at different doses; according to international standards, disinfection of drinking water should achieve a 4 log inactivation to reach safe levels; thus, the amount of UV dose that can achieve 4 log inactivation will be determined (USEPA, 2006). Table 2 shows the required UV dose to achieve 4 log inactivation for the listed microorganisms in three wavelengths. The next step focuses on qualitative analysis and comparison of the capacities for microbial inactivation. Table 2 shows that the UV-LED with 265 nm wavelength is used to achieve adjusted fluence values of 10.8 and 16.4 mJ/cm2 for over 4 log inactivation of E. coli K12 IFO3301, but the UV-LED emission wavelength at 280 nm is needed for the adjusted doses of 13.8 and 25.5 mJ/cm2 in the batch and flow-through reactors, respectively (Oguma et al., 2013). However, a large difference was noted in the UV doses for E. coli K12 IFO3301 (Oguma and Surapong, 2018); the required inactivation UV dose, featuring a certain advantage, is 6 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm and 9 mJ/cm2 in 280 nm compared with the values of 10.8 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm and 13.8 mJ/cm2 at 280 nm in previous batch types; the results depended on the different designs of UV-LED light source systems or water reactor systems (Oguma et al., 2013). In this article, we can determine the amount of UV dose that can achieve 4 log inactivation in different microorganisms: for B. subtilis, 28 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm, 48 mJ/cm2 at 280 nm, and 58 mJ/cm2 under LP; Qβ, 39 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm and 75 mJ/cm2 at 280 nm; L. pneumophila, 4.5 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm, 9 mJ/cm2 at 280 nm, and 6.5 mJ/cm2 under LP (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). We can also determine the UV dose for maximum inactivation of HAdV2. Table 2 shows the order of the ability of microorganisms to be inactivated by UV light: L. pneumophila > E. coli > B. subtilis > Qβ > HAdV2 (Oguma et al., 2013; Oguma and Surapong, 2018; Beck et al., 2017; Rodriguez et al., 2014). Thus, UV dose can be used as the reference value for disinfection of drinking water.

Analysis of inactivation rate constant for each microorganism in different wavelengths shows that a higher inactivation rate constant (K) (cm2/mJ) indicates an increased UV sensitivity of microorganisms to a specific wavelength. The inactivation rate constant (K) provides a direction for selecting the appropriate wavelength during disinfection. Table 3 shows the wide variation in the inactivation rate constants of the same species at different wavelengths. HAdV2 is a highly resistant virus. The UV-LED wavelength of 260 nm yields the highest inactivation rate constant (K) (0.045 cm2/mJ) among 260, 280, and 260+280 nm UV-LEDs or LP; for UV-LEDs with a coupling wavelength of 260+280 nm, the value of inactivation rate constant (K) lies between 260 nm to 280 nm (Beck et al., 2017). For B. pumilus, the coupling wavelength of 260+280 nm and the wavelength at 260 nm similarly yield a high inactivation rate constant (K) (0.012 cm2/mJ) (Beck et al., 2017). The 265 nm wavelength yields the highest inactivation rate constant (K) (0.174 cm2/mJ) for B. subtilis under 265 and 280 nm and LP (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). The inactivation rate constant (K) of P. aeruginosa and Qβ in UV-LEDs emitting at 265 nm reach 0.774 and 0.098 cm2/mJ, respectively, which are higher than that at longer wavelengths (Oguma and Surapong, 2018; Oguma et al., 2016). The highest inactivation rate constant (K) of MS2 equals 0.066 cm2/mJ in UV-LEDs emitting at 260 nm, whereas that of the coupling wavelength (260+280 nm) totals 0.61 cm2/mJ (Beck et al., 2017; Oguma et al., 2016; Rattanakul et al., 2014). For the most common bacteria, different E. coli strains show differences regarding the inactivation rate constant (K) (cm2/mJ). Table 3 shows that the highest inactivation rate constant (K) of E. coli CGMCC1.3373 reaches 0.41 cm2/mJ at 265 nm wavelength, whereas the second highest inactivation rate constant (K) is 0.36 cm2/mJ at the coupling wavelength of 265+280 nm (50%) (Li et al., 2017); however, in another study, E. coli K12 IFO3301 yielded a high inactivation rate constant (K) of 0.805 cm2/mJ at the wavelength of 265 nm and 0.811 cm2/mJ under LP lamps (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). These results are primarily attributed to the different internal structures of E. coli CGMCC1.3373 and E. coli K12 IFO3301. The UV dose and logarithmic inactivation in the inactivation fitting curve can be also analyzed as follows: a long “shoulder” indicates aggregation of

microorganisms and damage regeneration. “Tailing” mainly occurs in resistant species, including those with adaptive resistance. Different strains under each wavelength exhibit different inactivation rate constant (K), but E. coli is the most sensitive; on the other hand, bacteriophage Qβ and B. subtilis spores are more resistant compared with other bacteria (Oguma and Surapong, 2018). These microorganisms belonging to different species possess varying internal structures, resulting in different experimental results.

Based on the overall analysis, the sensitivity at ~260 nm is generally better than that at ~280 nm. However, in the current conditions, the UV-LED chips emitting at 260 nm incur considerably high production costs due to the considerable difficulties in R&D, whereas the optical intensity and external quantum output lack strength. On the other hand, the UV-LED with 280 nm wavelength is more effective in actual inactivation experiments as the 280 nm wavelength yields more external output and emits light with high efficiency. For example, Lawal et al. (2018) observed that the external quantum efficiency of an UV-LED reached 0.01%–4.5% and 0.1%–20.5% at ~255 and ~280 nm, respectively. That is, the external quantum efficiency of 280 nm UV-LEDs was almost 5–10 times that of 255 nm UV-LEDs, and although the disinfection efficiency at 255 mm was twice that at 280 nm, the total disinfection efficiency of the UV-LEDs operating at 280 nm was nearly five times larger (Aoyagi et al., 2011; Lawal et al., 2018). When Würtele et al. (2011) studied B. subtilis spore inactivation by UV-LED at the same input power and irradiation time of 300 s, they obtained a 2.7 logarithmic inactivation at the UV dose of 17.5 mJ/cm2 for the 269 nm UV-LEDs and a 3.7 logarithmic inactivation at the UV dose of 34.5 mJ/cm2 for the 282 nm UV-LEDs; therefore, the 282 nm UV-LEDs performed significantly better than the 269 nm UV-LEDs under the same timespan and input power owing to the higher photon efficiency of the 282 nm UV-LEDs. Aoyagi previously showed that UV-LEDs with wavelengths of ~280 nm were considerably easier to fabricate than those with wavelengths of ~255 nm given the lower Al content and much higher quantum efficiency of 280 nm UV-LEDs; thus, the 280 nm UV-LEDs yield a higher optical power output than the 255 nm UV-LEDs at the same drive current; the 280 nm UV-LEDs were also more effective in the actual inactivation experiment owing to their higher optical power output; therefore, the use of 282 nm UV-LEDs is preferable for the overall performance of the UV purification module (Aoyagi et al., 2011; Würtele et al., 2011).

The UV-induced damage of 280 nm UV-LEDs may inhibit reactivation, thus impairing protein activities, whereas less repaired damage is detected by endonuclease sensitive site assay. The 260 nm wavelength chip with an increased output power will result in increased inactivation efficiency. As a result, the 280 nm wavelength remains more effective and relatively cheap, but by the progress in the UV-LED chip R&D technology, the ~260 nm wavelength chips may feature a more competitive wavelength range of light in the future.

The design of the reactor is a key factor according to experimental analysis; it directly affects the result of the water treatment system and is directly related to the working mode of experimental models. To date, a simple reactor is most commonly used to perform a series of experiments on variation parameters, and it occasionally achieves the aim of studies by changing the structure and parameter from a UV transmitter. Most scholars also use novel methods of working modes, such as batch type and flow-through reactors, to change the state of microbes and further discuss their properties. New discoveries are achieved using these experimental models.

Several scholars compared the sensitivities of bacteriophages MS2, Qβ, and ΦX174 by the experimental models of batch type and flow-through reactors. In the batch type reactor, the UV-LEDs with 266 nm wavelength were used for irradiation. Then, over 7 log reductions of 9 mJ/cm2 for MS2 and Qβ and 1 mJ/cm2 for ΦX174 were observed during exposure. Scholars also observed the similar inactivation rate constants of MS2 and Qβ, whereas ΦX174 was the most sensitive to 279 nm UV-LEDs, LP, or the other experiments by a flow-through reactor (Kim et al., 2017). These experimental results are consistent with those of other studies on ssDNA virus ΦX174 or ssRNA viruses MS2 and Qβ; the UV sensitivities of viruses have been evaluated by the inactivation rate constant (K) (cm2/mJ), and statistically higher UV sensitivity and inactivation rate constant were observed in ΦX174 than in other viruses; these results coincide with the findings of other research that studied the three viruses by UV (Hijnen et al., 2006; Aoyagi et al., 2011). The 269 nm wavelength is close to the maximum absorption peak of B. subtilis spores and may present better germicidal effectiveness than 282 nm UV-LEDs. However, a different condition was observed when 269 and 282 nm UV-LEDs utilized the same input power

andexposuretime.Theseconditionsresultedindifferentfluencevalues.
 Static and flow-through tests are experimental methods designed for
 analysis. The flow-through test first indicates a linear correlation rela
tionship between inactivation and fluence and demonstrates a well
designed flow-through reactor; owing to their higher photon output,
 the 282 nm UV-LEDs caused a significantly better inactivation of B.
 subtilis spore than the 269 nm UV-LEDs at the same time range and
 input power (Chenetal., 2009);however, in flow-through tests, the in
activation rate constant (K) of B. subtilis spores was more than halved
 comparedwiththat in static tests, whereas the inactivation of B. subtilis
 was also reduced (Würtele et al., 2011). These results are attributed to
 the tailing phenomenon in the flow-type reactor, as shown in the
 fluence–response curves, resulting in lower inactivation efficiency
 than that in the batch reactor, which yielded a lower fluence-based in
activation rate constant of 29% in 265 nm and 32% in 280 nm wave
length (Oguma et al., 2013); tailing may originate from the
 aggregation of microorganisms and can cause spore aggregation,
 which was observed by scanning electron microscopy of the aggregate
 size in relation to the 3 ml polycarbonate filter pores (Mamane and
 Linden, 2005; Mattle and Kohn, 2012); the flow-type reactor requires
 a longer operation time than the batch reactor, providing higher possi
bility for microbial aggregation. In a flow-type reactor, UV-LEDs with
 different coupling peak emissions are less effective than those used
 alone and reduce the output power for each UV-LED (Oguma et al.,
 2013). UV-LEDs showed higher-time-based inactivation efficiency
 with peak emission at 280 nm owing to the highest output power
 achieved at this wavelength compared with that at 265 or 310 nm;
 meanwhile, UV-LEDs achieved the highest fluence-based efficiency at
 265 nm because of the highest UV absorbance of DNA at this wave
length (Jagger, 1967). Most UV reactors are used by flow-through reac
tors but not static reactors, as fluence is linearly associated with
 inactivation in flow-through reactors. Flow-through reactors can also
 accelerate water cycle treatment; hence, UV-LEDs are applied in water
 disinfection systems under flow-through reactors to minimize tailing
 and improve efficiency (Würtele et al., 2011; Oguma et al., 2013).
 The above conditions can be changed in experimental modes of dif
ferent reactors, and other aspects, including improvements of materials
 in the reactors, can be discussed. For instance, quartz glass reactors can
 beused aslight guides that use total emission to further improve disin
fection (Andrej et al., 2015).

Water treatment reactors generally include two forms: static and flow-through reactors. Different reactor designs exert varying effects on inactivation efficiency, as mentioned in the previous section. In this section, we will discuss the reactor designs that significantly affect inactivation efficiency and have been reported in literature. A reactor is generally related to the UV transmitter and application environment.

In general, static reactors use a deep or shallow petri dish with an either long or short radius. A stirrer is also necessary and is set up at the bottom or suspended midair in the reactor. The stirrer can accelerate the uniformity of water, allowing the UV transmitter to fully disinfect water samples. Several researchers used a petri dish equipped with a suspended agitator and was placed on the top of the UV LED array for static tests (Würtele et al., 2011). Others created a ring-shaped UVC LED apparatus attached to the outer rim of a fused silica quartz dish for disinfection (Oguma et al., 2016). However, possibly focusing more on the UV transmitter than the static reactor, most researchers followed the experimental requirements and designed a simple and suitably sized static reactor with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom and a UV transmitter equipped with a multiple-chip array on the top (Oguma et al., 2013; Chevremont et al., 2012b; Akgün and Ünlütürk, 2017; Li et al., 2017). The static reactor features a better aim at microorganisms, as water exhibits small vibration and no large flow. Thus, the static reactor is suitable for the inactivation of microorganisms with strong UV resistance. Notably, the microorganisms with weak anti-UV ability are also inactivated by static reactors, achieving an excellent inactivation effect. The radiation distance from UV transmitter to static reactor should be kept at a close range and carefully consider the microbial receiving radiant flux. This procedure increases the number of UV-LEDs to achieve a better disinfection effect, such as that shown in Fig. 3, where the reactor can use an array of nine UV-LED chips or more for light emission to improve the inactivation efficiency.

By contrast, flow-through reactors are more complex and include diverse models, which also depend on the application environment. Würtele et al. (2011) designed a reactor system in which the test water flows from the feed reservoir through the flow-through reactor and accumulates in the catchment tank. Other researchers designed a hollow chamber, through which the water sample can pass freely, surrounded with multiple chips, pumps, or reservoirs added to accelerate the water cycle (Aoyagi et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2017). This reactor design for water flow features dependency on pressure and a hardly controllable temperature; the irradiation may also be insufficient of deep UV light when a certain amount of water passes through the chamber. Thus, sufficient irradiation must be guaranteed. If the dosages necessary for 3 to 5 log reduction were calculated, the flow and circulating disinfection system can be used to accomplish higher reduction of Human Enteric Viruses, and the proper UVC-LED treatment level for sustaining potable water safety can be determined from the data. Another research team fabricated a water reactor made of two quartz sleeves according to the principle of the connected device, and the UV transmitter comprised three arrays that were bundled to build an equilateral triangular prism, which was placed in a quartz sleeve and inserted in the center of a cylinder (Oguma et al., 2013). This connector-type reactor design is more convenient to clean than other flow designs given the flexible detachability. Several researchers designed a disinfection system and placed the UV-LED lamp next to the quartz tube to be used in combination with the ultrasound module; this design may be suitable for small-household water-disinfection equipment (Andrej et al., 2015). In summary, flow-through reactor should maintain a sufficient irradiation in the chamber where water would flow (Fig. 4). This design is also a good way to set additional UV-LEDs chips array around the chamber or extend the chamber length, allowing the water to receive sufficient UV light.

At present, although different reactor designs could significantly affect inactivation efficiency, the disinfection effect of different water reactors is difficult to define accurately given the presence of numerous environmental factors. The disinfection effects of different reactors may be defined using experimental models, such as static and flow-through reactors (the latter performs better, as mentioned). In other words, more benefits and multiform design reactors can still be explored and improved. On the other hand, the application of static and flow-through reactors becomes more practical in life. For example, static reactors can be made with small UV-LED embedded device for air surface or shallow liquid disinfection, especially for the disinfection of small medical instruments, such as stethoscope membranes and surgical tools, or personal belongings and household articles, such as contact lenses, toothbrush, tableware, baby bottles, and toys; flow reactors can be used for flow water disinfection in water dispensers, water purifiers, and washing machines.

After ensuring the setup for the UV transmitter and reactor, we can still add external auxiliary equipment to further improve the disinfection efficiency. The final problem is to solve the radiation problem of microorganisms in water or enhance the convenience of the overall system. First, we should focus on key factors, such as water turbidity or dissolved organic matter (DOM), which affect water quality and weaken UV radiation.

When the water sample is turbid and contains particles, the reflection of particles in the water sample will reduce the UV radiation or possibly cause the accumulation of microorganisms (Blume and Neis, 2004). Thus, water treatment designs must maximize the UV dose to ensure that pathogens are adequately exposed to UV radiation and to effectively reduce pathogenic bacteria to a level safe for human consumption (Nelson et al., 2012). The low turbidity will also shelter microorganisms and can change the UV transmittance of water and reduce UV radiation on target microorganisms. Consequently, by adding water pretreatment designs to improve radiation from UV transmitters or exposing more water sample to radiation, we can combine several LEDs to irradiate a small volume of water, which is agitated during the entire treatment time (Nelson et al., 2012). Early in 2009, Gibson discussed the effect of suspension particles on urban waste water and demonstrated that low-frequency ultrasound can break down bacterial flora (Gibson et al., 2009). The main principle applied on the ultrasound unit is that low-power consumption in the UV-LED disinfection system suits implementation and can achieve acoustic cavitation, thereby creating a purification effect and achieving synergistic effects with UVC radiation within the disinfection system (Jin et al., 2013). This ultrasound pretreatment can achieve the effect of mechanical shear force and consequently change the particle size distribution as reported in previous studies (Zhou et al., 2017). For instance, several researches were conducted on the use of ultrasound-enhanced UV disinfection technology with combined theoretical and experimental bases. The generation of transient cavitation was demonstrated by disintegrating aluminum foil and adding multiple ultrasonic probes around a mercury lamp to improve the efficiency of UV disinfection (Andrej et al., 2014; Bazyar et al., 2013). Given its powerful effect, ultrasound pretreatment treatment is also a feasible method to improve UV disinfection efficiency.

One group proposed a new purification system combining UV-LED with solar cells; these nested auxiliary modules are innovative and useful in solving the power supply of UV-LED disinfection systems (Aoyagi et al., 2011). The mature and widely used auxiliary equipment adds an ultrasound treatment unit to improve the bactericidal effect.

DOM is ubiquitous in natural waters, and 90% of DOM includes humic substances that can be divided into hydrophobic (humic acids) and hydrophilic (fulvic acids) components (Barber et al., 2001; Thurman, 1985; Thurman and Malcolm, 1981); these substances can absorb UV (Liu et al., 2018). Humic acid was also discovered to display affinity for various surfaces, and its addition to water samples can coat bacteria to absorb UV and reduce the sensitivity of cells to UV light (Cantwell et al., 2008; Vilhunen et al., 2009). Thus, reducing the influence of DOM is another major challenge in water treatment systems. Coagulation–ultrafiltration processes, such as those involving aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, and polyaluminum chloride, can effectively remove DOM (Chow et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2018; Bu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2007).

A multiple filtration system or coagulation–ultrafiltration system should be embedded in the front-end systems using turbid water or water containing DOM as sample. Other auxiliary equipment that further improves UV disinfection efficiency still awaits discovery and exploration.

UV-LED water disinfection systems cover a wide range of topics. These systems include not only the microelectronics packaging technology of UV-LED chips or module design but also the inactivation of pathogens in water-environment engineering analysis. This subject requires technical personnel with mastery of comprehensive knowledge to perform analysis from various perspectives. This article is based on the comprehensive analysis and investigation of various wavelengths of disinfection and energy consumption of UV-LEDs and problems encountered in the water treatment process. Several constructive conclusions are drawn for reference purposes.

With regard to the investigation of the inactivation efficiency and energy consumption of UV-LEDs for pathogens at various wavelengths, selecting a wavelength and setting a system that matches high-efficiency UV-LED water disinfection equipment will benefit future studies. Future UV-LED water treatment designs should add a pretreatment process in high-turbidity water to reduce interference in the early stage (Nelson et al., 2012). UV dose is a key parameter in evaluating the effects of disinfection; it benefits from the integrated calculation of radiant flux, exposure time, and attenuation factors, among which attenuation factors, including water factor, reflection factor, divergence factor, and sensor factor, are particularly complex (Bolton and Linden, 2003); the improvement of water treatment systems will be accompanied by the improvement of attenuation factors. Thus, we must investigate various parameters and determine the rules to improve the disinfection efficiency of the entire water treatment system. This investigation shows that the disinfection efficiency of the entire water treatment system depends on two important parts: the controlling factors and the settings. The controlling factors include wavelength, optical efficiency, radiation flux, exposure time, radiation distance, and radiation dose, which are mainly derived from the UV-LED emission light source. On the other hand, the settings include the material selection and working model design of the reactor device, pretreatment of water samples, and external auxiliary system, which mainly originate from the water sample reaction system receiving UV light.

The specific conclusions and suggestions are as follows:
1) Analysis of UV dose responses for per log inactivation under the same wavelength shows the inactivation capacities for several pathogens: ΦX174 > E. coli > T type bacteriophage > B. subtilis > MS2 or Qβ > HAdV.
2) The wavelengths at 260 or 280 nm show strong inactivation characteristics, but 280 nm wavelength with a lower cost for a high light power may be a better choice.
3) In the case of radiation dose equivalent, high radiant flux and short exposure time may achieve more efficiency than low flux and prolonged exposure time. Higher radiation flux for disinfection may achieve higher efficiency, which is a direction required in-depth exploration.
4) A closer radiation distance will achieve a larger radiation flux, but disinfection remains on a close-range surface or near-surface water sample radiation given the extremely small external output power of UV-LED chips; this property must be urgently improved in the future.
5) The purity and uniformity of water sample can be significantly improved by increasing the UV transmission and reaction degree of microorganisms in water samples, setting up water treatment systems in circulation mode, or adding related auxiliary settings, such as ultrasound pretreatment, which can prevent the agglomeration of pathogenic bacteria, or coagulation–ultrafiltration process, which can effectively remove DOM.
6) Improving the quality of reaction equipment can increase service life. We can also select a reactor material that benefits the disinfection process.
