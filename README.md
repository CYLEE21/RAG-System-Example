# RAG System Example

## Overview
This repository contains a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system example designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of RAG for various applications. RAG combines information retrieval with natural language generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses, making it a versatile tool for **enterprises**, **academics**, and **individuals**. This project showcases how RAG can be applied to diverse use cases, from enterprise knowledge management to academic research and personal productivity.

The system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses a generative model to produce concise, meaningful answers. It is built to be modular, easy to set up, and customizable for different domains.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily integrate different retrieval mechanisms and generative models.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Add your own documents or datasets to tailor the system to specific needs.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for small-scale personal projects to large-scale enterprise applications.
- **Open-Source Tools**: Built with accessible libraries like LangChain, FAISS, and Hugging Face Transformers.

## Use Cases
### Enterprises
- **Knowledge Management**: Centralize and query internal documentation, employee handbooks, or customer support logs to improve operational efficiency.
- **Customer Support Automation**: Provide instant, accurate responses to customer inquiries by retrieving relevant information from product manuals or FAQs.
- **Data Analysis**: Summarize and extract insights from large volumes of unstructured data, such as reports or emails.

### Academics
- **Research Assistance**: Query academic papers, lecture notes, or datasets to quickly find relevant information and generate summaries.
- **Literature Review**: Automate the process of finding and summarizing related work for research papers or grant proposals.
- **Educational Tools**: Create interactive Q&A systems for students to explore course materials.

### Individuals
- **Personal Knowledge Base**: Organize and query personal notes, journals, or saved articles for quick reference.
- **Learning Aid**: Summarize online resources or books to accelerate learning on new topics.
- **Task Automation**: Generate responses or draft content based on personal documents, such as resumes or project plans.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip for installing dependencies
- Optional: GPU for faster model inference

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-system-example.git
   cd rag-system-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys (e.g., for Hugging Face or other services):
   ```plaintext
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

4. **Prepare the Knowledge Base**
   - Place your documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) in the `data/` folder.
   - Run the indexing script to create a vector store:
     ```bash
     python scripts/index_documents.py
     ```

## Usage
1. **Run the RAG System**
   Start the application to interact with the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Query the System**
   - Use the command-line interface or integrate with a web frontend (see `frontend/` folder for an optional UI).
   - Example query:
     ```plaintext
     What are the key benefits of using RAG for enterprise knowledge management?
     ```

3. **Customize**
   - Modify `config.yaml` to adjust retrieval and generation settings (e.g., model type, chunk size).
   - Add new documents to the `data/` folder and re-run the indexing script.

from src.generation import Generator

# Initialize components
retriever = Retriever(vector_store_path="data/vector_store")
generator = Generator(model_name="gpt2")

# Query the system
query = "What is RAG and how does it work?"
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
response = generator.generate_answer(query, docs)
print(response)
